#summary Moving targets referenced by EPUB3

= Introduction =

EPUB3 depends on several moving targets such as W3C working drafts.  This document enumerates these moving targets and also shows our strategy for minimizing risks caused by such moving targets.

Unicode, The Unicode Consortium. The Unicode Standard, Version 5.0.0, defined by: The Unicode Standard, Version 5.0 (Boston, MA, Addison-Wesley, 2007. ISBN 0-321-48091-0) is strictly speaking a moving target, but it is reasonably stable now.

CSS2.1: Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification is now a Proposed Recommendation. There are no significant risks.
