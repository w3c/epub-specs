== Proposed Additional Use Cases ==

  * To find a CJK ideographic character without knowing that character, Japanese users need text-entry search allowing input of one or more of the following:
    # the number of strokes used to write the character
    # [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_character) radicals]
    # [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana hiragana] readings ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kun%27yomi#Kun.27yomi_.28Japanese_reading.29 kun yomi], or pronunciation of the character based on a native Japanese word),
    # [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana katakana] readings ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kun%27yomi#On.27yomi_.28Chinese_reading.29 on yomi], or pronunciation based on the character's Chinese sound at time it was originally borrowed into Japanese)
