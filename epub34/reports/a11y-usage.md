## Candidate Recommendation Exit Criteria

The EPUB Working Group intends to exit the Candidate Recommendation stage and submit
the [EPUB Accessibility 1.1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-111/) specification for
consideration as a W3C Proposed Recommendation after documenting that publishers can
meet the requirements at WCAG 2.0 Level AA.

For this specification to advance to Proposed Recommendation, it has to be
proven that at least 5 publishers will produce at least 1 EPUB publication each that 
conform to [EPUB Accessibility 1.1 - WCAG 2.0 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-111/#sec-conf-reporting-pub).

Publishers are not expected to be producing content that claims conformance
to the specification prior to it becoming a recommendation, only that they have
verified that the content they produce now can meet the requirements by
verifying at least one publication.

Publishers currently meeting EPUB Accessibility 1.0 at WCAG 2.0 Level AA already
meet the requirements to claim conformance to the new specification, as the
new revision does not introduce stricter content requirements.
