			<p> EPUB® defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB

			<h2>About EPUB 3.4</h2>
			<p> EPUB 3.4 is a revision of the EPUB 3 specification, which can be considered as a successor to <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub33/">EPUB 3.3</a>.</p>

			<p> EPUB 3.4 is backward compatible with EPUB 3.3, insofar as any EPUB 3.3 document is also valid EPUB 3.4.
				In other words, moving from EPUB 3.3 to EPUB 3.4 does not require any changes to current publication
				workflows. </p>

			<p> The W3C process of standardization entails a thorough review of the specifications by Member experts,
				including checking the specification’s impact on implementations for internationalization, security,
				privacy, accessibility, and conformity to other Web standards. These reviews led to a number of small
				but important technical changes such as additional features to address bidirectional text, and more
				precise specification of security related details for scripts. The standard also includes detailed
				guidelines for implementers on the possible privacy and security problems. </p>

			<p> The Working Group has also created a comprehensive <a href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/index.html"
					>test suite</a> that systematically tests all normative features of the specification. </p>

				<h3>Specifications</h3>

				<p>EPUB 3 is currently defined by the following specifications:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>EPUB 3.4 [[epub-34]]: defines the authoring format and requirements for EPUB publications,
						comprising features such as the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">package</a> and <a
							data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">navigation</a> documents, <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">EPUB
							content documents</a>, <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-fixed-layouts">fixed layouts</a>, <a
							data-cite="epub-33#sec-media-overlays">media overlays</a>, and the <a
							data-cite="epub-33#sec-ocf">container format</a>. </li>
					<li>EPUB Reading Systems 3.4 [[epub-rs-34]]: defines the conformance requirements for EPUB 3 reading
						systems — the user agents that render EPUB 3 Publications. </li>
					<li>EPUB Accessibility 1.1.1 [[epub-a11y-111]]: specifies content conformance requirements for
						verifying the accessibility of EPUB 3 Publications. </li>
				</ul>

				<div class="note"> The recommendation-track documents include detailed change logs on the substantive
					changes since the previous official releases. See the change log for <a
						data-cite="epub-34#change-log">EPUB 3.4</a>, <a data-cite="epub-rs-34#change-log">EPUB reading
						systems 3.4</a>, and <a data-cite="epub-a11y-111#change-log">EPUB Accessibility 1.1.1</a>,
					respectively. </div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-doc-notes">
				<h3>Notes</h3>

				<p>Although the following documents are informative, they provide guidance related to implementing the
					EPUB 3 specifications as well as define experimental features.</p>

				<ul>
					<li> EPUB 3 Overview [[epub-overview-34]]: gives a high level overview of the main EPUB 3.4 concepts
						and terms. </li>
					<li> EPUB Accessibility Techniques 1.1.1 [[epub-a11y-tech-111]]: provides guidance on how to meet the
						EPUB Accessibility 1.1.1 [[epub-a11y-111]] discovery and accessibility requirements for EPUB
						publications. </li>
				</ul>

			<h2>How to Participate</h2>

			<p> The EPUB 3.4 specification is developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pm/">Publishing
					Maintenance Working Group</a>. All Working Group activities are conducted in an "open source"
				manner: the EPUB 3 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/">specifications' site</a> is publicly
				accessible. </p>

			<p> All comments on EPUB 3 specifications should be submitted via the <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues">EPUB 3 issue tracker</a> hosted on GitHub. (NOTE:
				you must login via a GitHub Account in order to submit an issue.) </p>
