			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-intro-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>EPUB 3 has been widely adopted as the format for digital books (ebooks), and this revision continues
					to increase the format's capabilities to better support a wider range of publication requirements,
					including complex layouts, rich media and interactivity, and global typography features. The
					expectation is that publishers will utilize the EPUB 3 format for a broad range of content,
					including books, magazines, and educational, professional, and scientific publications.</p>

				<p>This specification represents the core of EPUB 3 and includes the conformance requirements for [=EPUB
					publications=] — the product of the standard. The other specifications that comprise EPUB 3 are as
					follows:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><a data-cite="epub-rs-34#">EPUB 3 Reading Systems</a> [[epub-rs-34]] — defines the processing
							requirements for [=EPUB reading systems=] — the applications that consume EPUB publications
							and present their content to users.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a data-cite="epub-a11y-111#">EPUB Accessibility</a> [[epub-a11y-111]] — defines
							accessibility conformance and discovery requirements for EPUB publications.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These specifications represent the formal list recognized as belonging to EPUB 3 and that contain
					functionality normatively referenced as part of the standard. The development of extension
					specifications periodically adds new functionality to EPUB publications. Features and functionality
					defined outside of core revisions to the standard, while not formally recognized in this
					specification, are nonetheless available for [=EPUB creators=] and reading system developers to
					use.</p>

				<p>The non-normative <a data-cite="epub-overview-34#">EPUB 3 Overview</a> [[epub-overview-34]] provides
					a general introduction to EPUB 3. A list of technical changes from the previous version is also
					available in the <a href="#change-log">change log</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-intro-spec-org" class="informative">
				<h3>Organization</h3>

				<p>This section reviews the organization of this specification through the central product it defines:
					the [=EPUB publication=].</p>

				<p>An EPUB publication is, in its most basic sense, a bundle of resources with instructions on how to
					render those resources to present the content in a logical order. The types of resources that are
					allowed in EPUB publication, as well as restrictions on their use, are defined in <a
						href="#sec-publication-resources"></a>.</p>

				<p>A ZIP-based archive with the file extension <code>.epub</code> bundles the EPUB publication's
					resources for distribution. As conformant ZIP archives, EPUB publications can be unzipped by many
					software programs, simplifying both their production and consumption.</p>

				<p>The container format not only provides a means of determining that the zipped content represents an
					EPUB publication (the <code>mimetype</code> file), but also provides a universally named directory
					of non-normative resources (<code>/META-INF</code>). Key among these resources is the
						<code>container.xml</code> file, which directs reading systems to the available [=package
					documents=]. Refer to <a href="#sec-ocf"></a> for more information about the container format.</p>

				<p>An EPUB publication is typically represented by a single package document. This document includes
					metadata used by [=reading systems=] to present the content to the user, such as the title and
					author for display in a bookshelf as well as rendering metadata (e.g., whether the content is
					reflowable or has a fixed layout). It also provides a manifest of resources and includes a [=EPUB
					spine | spine=] that lists the default sequence in which to render documents as a user progresses
					through the content. Refer to <a href="#sec-package-doc"></a> for the requirements for the package
					document.</p>

				<p>The actual content of an EPUB publication — what users are presented with when they begin reading —
					is built on the Open Web Platform and comes in two flavors: XHTML and SVG. Called [=EPUB content
					documents=], these documents typically reference many additional resources required for their proper
					rendering, such as images, audio and video clips, scripts, and style sheets.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="#sec-contentdocs"></a> for detailed information about the rules and requirements to
					produce EPUB content documents, and [[epub-a11y-111]] for accessibility requirements.</p>

				<p>An EPUB publication also includes another key file called the [=EPUB navigation document=]. This
					document provides critical navigation capabilities, such as the table of contents, that allow users
					to navigate the content quickly and easily. The navigation document is a specialized type of [=XHTML
					content document=] which also allows EPUB creators to use it in the content (i.e., avoiding one
					table of contents for machine processing and another for user consumption). Refer to <a
						href="#sec-nav"></a> for more information about this document.</p>

				<p>EPUB publications by default are intended to reflow to fit the available screen space. It is also
					possible to create publications that have pixel-precise fixed layouts using images and/or CSS
					positioning. The metadata to control layouts are defined in <a href="#sec-rendering-control"
					></a>.</p>

				<p>[=Media overlay documents=] complement EPUB content documents. They provide declarative markup for
					synchronizing the text in EPUB content documents with prerecorded audio. The result is the ability
					to create a read-aloud experience where [=reading systems=] highlight the text as it is narrated.
					Refer to <a href="#sec-media-overlays"></a> for the definition of media overlay documents.</p>

				<p>While conceptually simple, an EPUB publication is more than just a collection of HTML pages and
					dependent assets in a ZIP package as presented here. Additional information about the primary
					features and functionality that EPUB publications provide to enhance the reading experience is
					available from the referenced specifications, and a more general introduction to the features of
					EPUB 3 is provided in the non-normative [[epub-overview-34]].</p>

				<p>Refer to [[epub-rs-34]] for the processing requirements for reading systems. Although it is not
					necessary that [=EPUB creators=] read that document to create EPUB publications, an understanding of
					how reading systems present the content can help craft publications for optimal presentation to
					users.</p>

				<h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>

				<div class="caution">
					<p>The technologies EPUB 3 builds on are constantly evolving. Some, typically referred to as
						"living" or "evergreen" standards, are subject to change daily and their impact on the validity
						of EPUB publications is immediate. Others are updated less frequently and the changes may not
						affect [=EPUB publications=] until EPUB 3 undergoes a new revision.</p>
					<p>In all cases, it is possible that previously valid features may become obsolete (e.g., due to a
						lack of support or because of security issues). [=EPUB creators=] should therefore be cautious
						about using any feature without broad support and keep their [=EPUB conformance checkers=] up to
						date.</p>
				</div>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-html">
					<h4>Relationship to HTML</h4>

					<p>The [[html]] standard is continuously evolving — there are no longer versioned releases of it.
						That standard, in turn, references various technologies that continue to evolve, such as MathML,
						SVG, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

					<p>The benefit of this approach for EPUB is that [=EPUB publications=] always keep pace with changes
						to the web without the need for new revisions. [=EPUB creators=], however, must keep track of
						the various changes to HTML and the technologies it references to ensure they keep their
						processes up to date.</p>

					<p>The <a href="#sec-xhtml">HTML profile defined by this specification</a> inherits all definitions
						of semantics, structure and processing behaviors from HTML unless otherwise specified.</p>

					<p>In addition, this specification <a href="#sec-xhtml-extensions">defines a set of extensions</a>
						to the [[html]] document model that EPUB creators may include in [=XHTML content
						documents=].</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-svg">
					<h4>Relationship to SVG</h4>

					<p>This specification does not reference a specific version of [[svg]], but instead uses an undated
						reference. Whenever there is any ambiguity in this reference, the latest recommended
						specification is the authoritative reference.</p>

					<p>This approach ensures that EPUB will always keep pace with changes to the SVG standard. [=EPUB
						creators=], however, must keep track of changes to the SVG standard to ensure they keep their
						processes up to date.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-css">
					<h4>Relationship to CSS</h4>

					<p>EPUB 3 supports CSS as defined by the CSS Working Group Snapshot [[csssnapshot]]. EPUB 3 also
						maintains some prefixed CSS properties, to ensure consistent support for global languages.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-mathml">
					<h4>Relationship to MathML</h4>

					<p>EPUB 3 only supports <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter3.html">Presentation
							Markup</a> [[mathml3]]. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter4.html">Content
							Markup</a> is only allowed in <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter5.html#mixing.elements.annotation.xml">structured
							markup annotations</a>.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-smil">
					<h4>Relationship to SMIL</h4>

					<p>This specification relies on a subset of [[smil3]], from which the media overlays elements and
						attributes defined in <a href="#sec-overlays-def"></a> are derived.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-url">
					<h4>Relationship to URL</h4>

					<p>This specification refers to the [[url]] standard for terminology and processing related to URLs
						expressed in [=EPUB publications=]. It is anticipated that new and revised web formats will
						adopt this standard, but until then this may put this specification in conflict with the
						internal requirements for some formats (e.g., valid relative paths), specifically with respect
						to the use of internationalized URLs. If a format does not allow internationalized URLs (i.e.,
						URLs must conform to [[rfc3986]] or earlier), that requirement takes precedence within those
						resources.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This specification defines the following terms specific to EPUB 3.</p>

					<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section links to its definition.</p>

				<h3>Conformance checking</h3>

				<p>Due to the complexity of this specification and number of technologies used in [=EPUB publications=],
					[=EPUB creators=] are advised to use an [=EPUB conformance checker=] to verify the conformance of
					their content.</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/">EPUBCheck</a> is the de facto EPUB conformance
					checker used by the publishing industry and has been updated with each new version of EPUB. It is
					integrated into a number of authoring tools and also available in alternative interfaces and other
					languages (for more information, refer to its <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/docs/apps-and-tools/">Apps and Tools
					page</a>).</p>

				<p>When verifying their EPUB publications, EPUB creators should ensure they do not violate the
					requirements of this specification (practices identified by the keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", and
					"REQUIRED"). These types of issues will often result in EPUB publications not rendering or rendering
					in inconsistent ways. These issues are typically reported as errors or critical errors.</p>

				<p>EPUB creators should also ensure that their EPUB publications do not violate the recommendations of
					this specification (practices identified by the keywords "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "RECOMMENDED").
					Failure to follow these practices does not result in an invalid EPUB publication but may lead to
					interoperability problems and other issues that impact the user reading experience. These issues are
					typically reported as warnings.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Vendors, distributors, and other retailers of EPUB publications should consider the importance of
						recommended practices before basing their acceptance or rejection on a zero-issue outcome from
						an EPUB conformance checker. There will be legitimate reasons why EPUB creators cannot follow

			<h2>Publication resources</h2>

			<section id="sec-pub-res-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>An [=EPUB publication=] is made up of many different categories of resources, not all of which are
					mutually exclusive. Some resources are [=publication resources=], some are not. Some publication
					resources are allowed in the [=EPUB spine | spine=] by default, while all others require fallbacks.
					Some resources can be used in rendering [=EPUB content documents=], while others can only be used
					with fallbacks.</p>

				<p>Trying to understand these differences by reading the technical definitions of each category of
					resource can be complex. To make the categorizations easier to understand, this introduction uses
					the concept of different planes to explain how resources are grouped and referred to.</p>

				<p>The three planes are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The [=manifest plane=] — The manifest plane holds all the resources of the EPUB publication
						(namely, publication resources and [=linked resources=]).</li>
					<li>The [=spine plane=] — The spine plane holds only the resources used in rendering the spine
						(namely, EPUB content documents and [=foreign content documents=]).</li>
					<li>The [=content plane=] — The content plane holds only the resources used in the rendering of EPUB
						and foreign content documents (namely, [=core media type resources=], [=foreign resources=] and
						[=exempt resources=]).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The same resource may exist on more than one plane and will be referred to differently in this
					specification depending on which plane is being discussed. For example, a core media type resource
					used in the rendering of an EPUB content document (on the content plane) may also be a foreign
					content document if it is also listed in the spine (the spine plane).</p>

				<p>The following sections describe these planes in more detail.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Refer to <a href="#publication-resources-example"></a> for a detailed example showing how
						resources fit into the different planes.</p>
				</div>

				<section id="sec-manifest-plane">
					<h4>The manifest plane</h4>

					<p>To <dfn class="export" data-lt-no-plural="">manifest plane</dfn> defines all the resources of an
						[=EPUB publication=]. It is analogous to the [=package document=] [=EPUB manifest | manifest=],
						but includes resources not present in that list.</p>

					<p>The primary resources in this group are designated [=publication resources=], which are all the
						resources used in rendering an EPUB publication to the user. [=EPUB creators=] always have to
						list these resources in the [^manifest^] element.</p>

					<p>Publication resources are further classified by their use(s) in the [=spine plane=] and [=content
						plane=].</p>

					<p>The manifest plane also contains a set of [=linked resources=]. These resources are tangential to
						the direct rendering. They include, for example, metadata records and links to external content
						(e.g., where to purchase an EPUB publication).</p>

					<p>Unlike publication resources, they are not listed in the package document manifest (i.e., because
						they are not essential to rendering the EPUB publication). They are instead defined in [^link^]
						elements in the package document metadata. These elements define their nature and purpose
						similar to how manifest [^item^] elements define publication resource. (In this way, they are
						like an extension of the manifest.)</p>

					<p>Refer to <a href="#sec-link-elem"></a> for more information about linked resources.</p>

					<p>Resources in the manifest plane are also sometimes broken down by where they are located.
						Although most publication resources have to be located in the EPUB container (called [=container
						resources=]), EPUB 3 allows <a href="#sec-resource-locations">audio, video, font and script data
							resources</a> to be hosted outside the container. These exceptions were made to speed up the
						download and loading of EPUB publications, as these resources are typically quite large, and, in
						the case of fonts, not essential to the presentation. When remotely hosted, these publication
						resources are referred to as [=remote resources=].</p>

					<p>Since linked resources are not essential to the rendering of an EPUB publication, there are no
						requirements on where they are located and consequently no special naming of them based on their
						location. They may be located within the EPUB container or outside it.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Hyperlinked content outside the EPUB container (e.g., web pages) are not publication
							resources, and consequently are not listed in the manifest. Reading systems will normally
							open these links in a separate browser instance, not as part of the EPUB publication.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-spine-plane">
					<h4>The spine plane</h4>

					<p>The <dfn class="export" data-lt-no-plural="">spine plane</dfn> defines resources used in the
						default reading order established by the [=EPUB spine | spine=], which includes both <a
							href="#attrdef-itemref-linear">linear and non-linear content</a>. The spine instructs
						[=reading systems=] on how to load these resources as the user progresses through the [=EPUB
						publication=]. Although many resources may be bundled in an [=EPUB container=], they are not all
						allowed by default in the spine.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3 defines a special class of resources called [=EPUB content documents=] that [=EPUB
						creators=] can use in the spine without any restrictions. EPUB content documents encompass both
						[=XHTML content documents=] and [=SVG content documents=].</p>

					<p>To use any other type of resource in the spine, called a [=foreign content document=], requires
						including a fallback to an EPUB content document. This extensibility model allows EPUB creators
						to experiment with formats while ensuring that reading systems are always able to render
						something for the user to read, as there is no guarantee of support for foreign content
						documents.</p>

					<p>A mechanism called <a href="#sec-manifest-fallbacks">manifest fallbacks</a> allows EPUB creators
						to provide fallbacks for foreign content documents. In this model, the [=EPUB manifest |
						manifest=] entry for the foreign content document must include a <a
							href="#attrdef-item-fallback"><code>fallback</code> attribute</a> that points to the next
						possible resource for reading systems to try when they do not support its format. Although not
						common, a fallback resource can specify another fallback, thereby making chains many resources
						deep. The one requirement is that there must be at least one EPUB content document in a
						[=manifest fallback chain=].</p>

					<p>Although they are not directly listed in the spine, all of the resources in the fallback chain
						are considered part of the spine, and by extension part of the spine plane, since any may be
						used by a reading system.</p>

					<p>Refer to <a href="#sec-manifest-fallbacks"></a> for more information.</p>

					<div class="caution">
						<p id="caution-fallbacks">Although manifest fallbacks fulfill the technical requirements of
							EPUB, there is little practical support for them in reading systems. Their use is strongly
							discouraged as it can lead to unreadable publications.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="note">
						<p>It is possible to provide manifest fallbacks for EPUB content documents, but this is not
							required or common. For example, a [=scripted content document=] could have a fallback to an
							unscripted alternative for reading systems that do not support scripting.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-content-plane">
					<h4>The content plane</h4>

					<p>The <dfn class="export" data-lt-no-plural="">content plane</dfn> classifies resources that are
						used when rendering [=EPUB content documents=] and [=foreign content documents=]. These types of
						resources include embedded media, CSS style sheets, scripts, and fonts. These resources fall
						into three categories based on their reading system support: [=core media type resources=],
						[=foreign resources=], and [=exempt resources=].</p>

					<p>A core media type resource is one that [=reading systems=] have to support, so it can be used
						without restriction in EPUB or foreign content documents. For more information about core media
						type resources, refer to <a href="#sec-core-media-types"></a>.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Being a core media type resource does not mean that reading systems will always render the
							resource, as not all reading systems support all features of EPUB 3. A reading system
							without a [=viewport=], for example, will not render visual content such as images.</p>
					</div>

					<p>The opposite of core media type resources are foreign resources. These are resources that reading
						systems are not guaranteed to support the rendering of. As a result, similar to how using
						foreign content documents in the spine requires fallbacks to ensure their rendering, using
						foreign resources in content documents also requires fallbacks. These fallbacks are provided in
						one of two ways: using the capabilities of the host format or via manifest fallbacks.</p>

					<p>The preferred method is to use the fallback capabilities of the host format. Many HTML elements,
						for example, have intrinsic fallback capabilities. One example is the [^picture^]
						element&#160;[[html]], which allows [=EPUB creators=] to specify multiple alternative image
						formats.</p>

					<p>If an intrinsic fallback method is not available, it is also possible to use manifest fallbacks,
						but this method, as <a href="#caution-fallbacks">cautioned against</a> in the previous section,
						is discouraged. For more information about foreign resources, refer to <a
							href="#sec-foreign-resources"></a>.</p>

					<p>Falling between core media type resources and foreign resources are exempt resources. These are
						most closely associated with foreign resources, as there is no guarantee that reading systems
						will render them. But like core media types, they do not require fallbacks.</p>

					<p>Exempt resources tend to address specific cases for which there are no core media types defined,
						but for which providing a fallback would prove cumbersome or unnecessary. These include
						embedding video, adding accessibility tracks, and linking to resources from the [[html]] <a
							data-cite="html#the-link-element"><code>link</code></a> element.</p>

					<p>Refer to <a href="#sec-exempt-resources"></a> for more information about these exceptions.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>A common point of confusion arising from core media type resources is the listing of XHTML
							and SVG as core media type resources with the requirement the markup conform to their
							respective EPUB content document definitions. This allows EPUB creators to embed both XHTML
							and SVG documents in EPUB content documents while keeping consistent requirements for
							authoring and reading system support.</p>

						<p>In practice, it means that EPUB creators can put XHTML and SVG core media type resources in
							the spine without any modification or fallback (they are also conforming XHTML and SVG
							content documents), but this is a unique case. All other core media type resources become
							foreign content documents when used in the spine (i.e., foreign content documents include
							all foreign resources and all core media type resources except for XHTML and SVG).</p>

				<h3>Exempt resources</h3>

				<p>An [=exempt resource=] shares properties with both [=foreign resources=] and [=core media type
					resources=]. It is most similar to a [=foreign resource=] in that it is not guaranteed [=reading
					system=] support, but, like a core media type resource, does not require a fallback.</p>

				<p>In some cases, the exemptions defined in this section overlap with how existing core media type
					resources are included in [=EPUB content documents=] (e.g., using the [[html]] <a
						data-cite="html#the-link-element"><code>link</code></a> element to include CSS style sheets,
					importing fonts into CSS, or using the [[html]] [^script^] element for JavaScripts). Although this
					superficially makes the resources similar in terms of not requiring fallbacks, core media types are
					differentiated by having stronger support expectations in reading systems. A core media type
					resource does not become an exempt resource just because they share the same inclusion mechanism.
					And without an exemption, an exempt resource would be a [=foreign resource=].</p>

				<p>There are only a small set of special cases for exempt resources. Video, for example, are exempt from
					fallbacks because there is no consensus on a core media type video format at this time (i.e., there
					is no format to fallback to). Similarly, audio and video tracks are exempt to allow [=EPUB
					creators=] to meet accessibility requirements using whatever format reading systems support
					best.</p>

				<p>The following list details cases of content-specific exempt resources, including any restrictions on
					where EPUB creators can use them.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt id="exempt-fonts">Fonts</dt>
					<dd id="confreq-resources-cd-fonts">
						<p>Font resources are exempt resources.</p>
						<p>This exemption allows EPUB creators to use any font format without a fallback, regardless of
							reading system support expectations, as CSS rules will ensure a fallback font in case of no
							support.</p>

								requirements for fonts</a> [[epub-rs-34]] for more information.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>Although reading systems are encouraged to support at least one of the H.264 [[?h264]]
								and VP8 [[?rfc6386]] video codecs, support for video codecs is not a conformance
								requirement. EPUB creators must consider factors such as breadth of adoption, playback
								quality, and technology royalties when deciding which video formats to include.</p>
						</div>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The exemptions made above do not apply to the [=EPUB spine | spine=]. If an exempt resource is
						used in the spine, and it is not also an EPUB content document, it will require a fallback in
						that context.</p>
				</div>

				<p id="confreq-foreign-no-fallback">In addition to the content-specific exemptions, a resource is
					classified as an exempt resource if:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>it is not referenced from a spine [^itemref^] element (i.e., used as a [=foreign content
							document=]); <strong><em>and</em></strong></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>it is not directly rendered in its native format in an EPUB content document.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This exemption allows EPUB creators to include resources in the [=EPUB container=] that are not for
					use by EPUB reading systems. Resources that benefit from this exemption include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>script code modules, such as WebAssembly [[?wasm-core-2]];</li>
					<li>script inputs, such as fetched [[?fetch]] data or images (refer to <a
							href="#confreq-cd-scripted-flbk"></a> for restrictions on dynamically adding such resources
						to EPUB content documents);</li>
					<li>data files for use by external applications (e.g., a scientific journal might include a data set
						with instructions on how to extract it from the EPUB container).</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="note">
					<p>An example of a resource not exempted by this rule would be a foreign image resource referenced
						by a <a data-cite="css-values#urls"><code>url</code> function</a> [[css-values]] in a CSS style
						sheet, as this would result in the non-core media type format being displayed.</p>
				</div>

				<p>The exemption also allows EPUB creators to use foreign resources in foreign content documents without
					reading systems or [=EPUB conformance checkers=] having to understand the fallback capabilities of
					those resources (i.e., the requirement for a fallback for the foreign content document covers any
					rendering issues within it). As the resource is not referenced from an EPUB content document, it
					automatically becomes exempt from fallbacks.</p>

					<h5>Manifest fallbacks</h5>

					<p>Manifest fallbacks are a feature of the [=package document=] that create a <dfn class="export"
							>manifest fallback chain</dfn> for a [=publication resource=], allowing [=reading systems=]
						to select an alternative format they can render.</p>

					<p>Fallback chains are created using the <a href="#attrdef-item-fallback"><code>fallback</code>
							attribute</a> on [=EPUB Manifest | manifest=] [^item^] elements. This attribute references
						the <a data-cite="xml#id">ID</a> [[xml]] of another manifest <code>item</code> that is a
						fallback for the current <code>item</code>. The ordered list of all the references that a
						reading system can reach, starting from a given <code>item</code>'s <code>fallback</code>
						attribute, represents the full fallback chain for that <code>item</code>. This chain also
						represents the [=EPUB creator | EPUB creator's=] preferred fallback order.</p>

					<p>There are two cases for manifest fallbacks:</p>

					<dl>
						<dt id="spine-fallbacks">Spine fallbacks</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>EPUB creators MUST specify a fallback chain for a [=foreign content document=] to ensure
								that reading systems can always render the [=EPUB spine | spine=] item. In this case,
								the chain MUST contain at least one [=EPUB content document=].</p>
							<p>EPUB creators MAY provide fallbacks for EPUB content documents (e.g., to provide a <a
									href="#confreq-cd-scripted-flbk">fallback for scripted content</a>).</p>
							<p>When a fallback chain includes more than one EPUB content document, EPUB creators can use
								the <a href="#attrdef-properties"><code>properties</code> attribute</a> to differentiate
								the purpose of each.</p>
						</dd>

						<dt id="content-fallbacks">Content fallbacks</dt>
						<dd>
							<div class="note">
								<p>The original purpose for content fallbacks was to specify fallback images for the
									[[html]] [^img^] element. As HTML now has intrinsic fallback mechanism for images,
									the use of content fallbacks is strongly discouraged. EPUB creators should always
									use the intrinsic fallback capabilities of [[html]] and [[svg]] to provide fallback
									content.</p>
							</div>
							<p>EPUB creators MUST provide a content fallback for [=foreign resources=] when the elements
								that reference them do not have intrinsic fallback capabilities. In this case, the
								fallback chain MUST contain at least one [=core media type resource=].</p>
							<p>EPUB creators MAY also provide manifest fallbacks for core media type resources (e.g., to
								allow reading systems to select from more than one image format).</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>Regardless of the type of manifest fallback specified, fallback chains MUST NOT contain
						self-references or circular references to <code>item</code> elements in the chain.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>As it is not possible to use manifest fallbacks for resources represented in <a
								href="#sec-data-urls">data URLs</a>, EPUB creators can only represent foreign resources
							as data URLs where an intrinsic fallback mechanism is available.</p>

						<h5>HTML <code>audio</code> and <code>video</code> fallbacks</h5>

						<p id="confreq-resources-cd-fallback-media">[=EPUB creators=] MUST NOT use embedded
							[[html]]&#160;[=flow content=] within a <a data-cite="html#media-elements">media element</a>
							(i.e, <a data-cite="html#the-audio-element"><code>audio</code></a> or <a

						<h5>HTML <code>img</code> fallbacks</h5>

						<p id="confreq-resources-cd-fallback-img">Due to the variety of sources that [=EPUB creators=]

								</ul>

									<code>[^img/srcset^]</code> attributes provided EPUB creators define a <a
									href="#sec-manifest-fallbacks">manifest fallback</a>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h5>HTML <code>script</code> element</h5>

						<p>Although data blocks have a separate MIME media type [[rfc2046]] from their containing
							[=XHTML content document=], it is not possible to provide intrinsic fallbacks as no such
							mechanisms are specified for the [[html]] [^script^] element. It is also not possible to
							provide manifest fallbacks because data blocks cannot be defined as standalone files in the
							EPUB container but are always embedded as inline <code>script</code> elements.</p>

						<p>But, as the <code>script</code> element does not represent user content — <a
								data-cite="html#data-block">data blocks</a> are not rendered unless manipulated by
							script, and content rendered by scripts already has <a href="#confreq-cd-scripted-flbk">core
								media type requirements</a> — requiring fallbacks for the raw data does not serve a
							useful purpose.</p>

						<p>Consequently, to ensure that [=EPUB creators=] can include data blocks for scripting
							purposes, they are exempt from fallback requirements.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>This exemption aligns data blocks with the <a href="#confreq-foreign-no-fallback"
									>exemption for data files</a>.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="note">

				<p>When resources have to be located outside the EPUB container, EPUB creators are RECOMMENDED to

				<h3>Data URLs</h3>

				<p>The <a data-cite="rfc2397#"><code>data:</code> URL scheme</a> [[rfc2397]] is used to encode resources
					directly into a URL string. The advantage of this scheme is that it allows [=EPUB creators=] to
					embed a resource within another, avoiding the need for an external file.</p>

				<p>EPUB creators MUST NOT use data URLs in the following scenarios where they can result in a
					[=top-level content document=] or [=top-level browsing context=] [[html]]:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>in <code>href</code> attributes in the package document — this applies both to manifest
							[^item^] elements and metadata [^link^] elements;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>in the <code>href</code> attribute on [[html]] or [[svg]] <code>a</code> elements, except
							when inside an [^iframe^] element&#160;[[html]];</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>in the <code>href</code> attribute on [[html]] <code>area</code> elements, except when inside
							an <code>iframe</code> element;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>in calls to [[ecmascript]] <code>window.open</code> or <code>document.open</code>.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="note">
					<p>These restrictions on the use of data URLs are to prevent security issues and also to ensure that
						[=reading systems=] can determine where to take a user next (i.e., because data URLs cannot be
						referenced from the [=EPUB spine | spine=]).</p>

					<p>The list of prohibited uses for data URLs is subject to change as the respective standards that
						allow their use evolve.</p>
				</div>

				<p>A consequence of embedding is that the data in a data URL is not considered its own unique
					[=publication resource=] for manifest reporting purposes (i.e., only its containing publication
					resource gets listed). As this data has its own media type, however, it is still subject to <a
						href="#sec-foreign-resources">foreign resource restrictions</a>. EPUB creators MUST therefore
					encode data URLs as [=core media type resources=] or provide a fallback using the intrinsic fallback
					mechanisms of the host format.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>During the preparation steps in producing an EPUB publication, OCF may be used as the container
						format when exchanging in-progress publications between different individuals and/or different

					<li>When providing an EPUB publication from publisher or conversion house to the distribution or
						sales channel, OCF is the recommended container format to be used as the transport format.</li>
					<li>When delivering the final EPUB publication to an [=EPUB reading system=] or user, OCF is the
						required format for the container that holds all of the assets that make up the
						publication.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This section defines the rules for structuring the file collection in the abstract: the "abstract
					container". It also defines the rules for the representation of this abstract container within a ZIP
					archive: the "physical container". The rules for ZIP physical containers build upon the ZIP
					technologies used by [[odf]].</p>

				<p>OCF also defines a standard method for <a href="#sec-font-obfuscation">obfuscating embedded fonts</a>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>The [=OCF abstract container=] file system model uses a single common [=root directory=]. All
						[=container resources=] are located within the directory tree headed by the root directory, but
						no specific file system structure for them is mandated by this specification.</p>

					<p>The file system model also includes a mandatory directory named <code>META-INF</code> that is a
						direct child of the root directory and stores the following special files:</p>

					<dl class="variablelist">
						<dt>
							<code>container.xml</code>

					<h4>File and directory structure</h4>

					<p>The virtual file system for the [=OCF abstract container=] MUST have a single common [=root
						directory=] for all the contents of the container.</p>

					<p>The OCF abstract container MUST include a directory for configuration files named
							<code>META-INF</code> that is a direct child of the container's root directory. Refer to <a
							href="#sec-container-metainf"></a> for the requirements for the contents of this
						directory.</p>

					<p>The file name <code>mimetype</code> in the root directory is reserved for use by [=OCF ZIP
						containers=], as explained in <a href="#sec-container-zip"></a>.</p>

					<p>Files in the <code>META-INF</code> directory and the <code>mimetype</code> file are not
						[=publication resources=] so MUST NOT be listed in the [=EPUB manifest|manifest=].</p>

					<p>[=EPUB creators=] MAY locate all other files within the OCF abstract container in any location
						descendant from the root directory, provided they are not within the <code>META-INF</code>
						directory. EPUB creators MUST NOT reference files in the <code>META-INF</code> directory from an
						[=EPUB publication=].</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Some [=reading systems=] do not provide access to resources outside the directory where the
							[=package document=] is stored. EPUB creators should therefore place all resources at or
							below the directory containing the package document to avoid interoperability issues.</p>

						<p>This problem is more commonly encountered when <a data-cite="epub-multi-rend-11#container"

					<div class="note" id="note-cru-explanation">
						<p>The container root URL is the URL assigned by the [=reading system=] to the root of the

						<p>However, a reading system cannot arbitrarily use any URL, but one that honors the constraints

							always be parsed to a URL of a resource within the container (which may or may not exist).
							The primary reason for these constraints is to avoid potential run-time security issues that
							would be caused by parsed URLs "leaking" outside the container files.</p>

						<p>For example, URLs like <code>https://localhost:12345/</code> or
								<code>https://www.example.org:12345/</code> honor these properties. But URLs like
								<code>https://localhost:12345/path/to.epub/</code>,
								<code>file:///path/to.epub#path=/</code>, or <code>jar:file:/path/to.epub!/EPUB/</code>
							do not (parsing the URL string "<code>..</code>" with these three examples as base would
							return <code>https://localhost:12345/path/</code>, <code>file:///path/</code>, and a parsing
							error, respectively). It is the responsibility of the reading system to assign a URL to the

								<p>The goal of the algorithm is to detect whether <var>url</var> could be seen as

								<p class="note">An <a href="#app-schema-encryption">XML Schema</a> also informally

								<p>OCF encrypts individual files independently, trading off some security for improved

									Encryption in this way exposes the directory structure and file naming of the whole
									package.</p>

								<p>OCF uses XML Encryption [[xmlenc-core1]] to provide a framework for encryption,
									allowing a variety of algorithms to be used. XML Encryption specifies a process for
									encrypting arbitrary data and representing the result in XML. Even though an [=OCF
									abstract container=] may contain non-XML data, [=EPUB creators=] can use XML
									Encryption to encrypt all data in an [=OCF abstract container=]. OCF encryption
									supports only the encryption of entire files within the container, not parts of
									files. EPUB creators MUST NOT encrypt the <code>encryption.xml</code> file when
									present.</p>

								<p>Encrypted data replaces unencrypted data in an OCF abstract container. For example,
									if an EPUB creator encrypts an image named <code>photo.jpeg</code>, they should
									replace the contents of the <code>photo.jpeg</code> resource with its encrypted
									contents. Within the ZIP directory, EPUB creators SHOULD store encrypted files
									rather than Deflate-compress them.</p>

								<p id="encryption-obfuscation">Note that some situations require obfuscating the storage
									of embedded fonts referenced by an [=EPUB publication=] to make them more difficult
									to extract for unrestricted use. Although obfuscation is not encryption, reading
									systems use the <code>encryption.xml</code> file in conjunction with the <a
										href="#sec-font-obfuscation">font obfuscation algorithm</a> to identify fonts to
									deobfuscate.</p>

								<p id="encryption-restrictions">EPUB creators MUST NOT encrypt the following files:</p>

								<h6>Order of compression and encryption</h6>

								<p>When stored in an [=OCF ZIP container=], [=EPUB creators=] SHOULD compress streams of
									data with [=non-codec=] content types before encrypting them. EPUB creators MUST use
									Deflate compression. This practice ensures that file entries stored in the ZIP
									container have a smaller size.</p>

								<p>EPUB creators SHOULD NOT compress streams of data with [=codec=] content types before
									encrypting them. In such cases, additional compression introduces unnecessary
									processing overhead at production time (especially with large resource files) and
									impacts audio/video playback performance at consumption time. In some cases, the
									combination of compression with some encryption schemes might even compromise the
									ability of [=reading systems=] to handle partial content requests (e.g. HTTP byte
									ranges), due to the technical impossibility to determine the length of the full
									resource ahead of media playback (e.g. HTTP Content-Length header).</p>

								<p>When EPUB creators compress streams of data before encrypting, they SHOULD provide
									additional <code>EncryptionProperties</code> metadata to specify the size of the
									initial resource (i.e., before compression and encryption), as per the
										<code>Compression</code> XML element defined below. When EPUB creators do not
									compress streams of data before encrypting, they MAY provide the additional

				<h3>Font obfuscation</h3>

				<div class="caution">
					<p>Better methods of protecting fonts exist. Both [[woff]] and [[woff2]] fonts, for example, allow
						the embedding of licensing information and provide some protection through font table
						compression. The use of remotely hosted fonts also allows for font subsetting. [=EPUB creators=]
						are advised to use font obfuscation as defined in this section only when no other options are
						available to them. See also the <a href="#fobfus-limitations">limitations of
						obfuscation</a>.</p>
				</div>

				<section id="fobfus-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>Since an [=OCF ZIP container=] is fundamentally a ZIP file, commonly available ZIP tools can be
						used to extract any unencrypted content stream from the package. Moreover, the nature of ZIP
						files means that their contents might appear like any other native container on some systems
						(e.g., a folder).</p>

					<p>While this simplicity of ZIP files is quite useful, it also poses a problem when ease of
						extraction of fonts is not a desired side-effect of not encrypting them. An [=EPUB creator=] who
						wishes to include a third-party font, for example, typically does not want that font extracted
						and re-used by others. More critically, many commercial fonts allow embedding, but embedding a
						font implies making it an integral part of the [=EPUB publication=], not just providing the
						original font file along with the content.</p>

					<p>Since integrated ZIP support is so ubiquitous in modern operating systems, simply placing a font
						in the [=OCF ZIP container=] is insufficient to signify that the font cannot be reused in other
						contexts. This uncertainty can undermine the otherwise useful font embedding capability of EPUB
						publications.</p>

					<p>To discourage reuse of their fonts, some font vendors might only allow their use in EPUB
						publications if the fonts are bound in some way to the EPUB publication. That is, if the font
						file cannot be installed directly for use on an operating system with the built-in tools of that
						computing device, and it cannot be directly used by other EPUB publications.</p>

					<p>It is beyond the scope of this specification to provide a digital rights management or
						enforcement system for fonts. This section instead defines a method of obfuscation that will
						require additional work on the part of the final OCF recipient to gain general access to any
						obfuscated fonts.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="fobfus-limitations" class="informative">
					<h4>Limitations</h4>

					<p>This specification does not claim that obfuscation constitutes encryption, nor does it guarantee
						that the resource will be secure from copyright infringement. The hope is only that this
						algorithm will meet the requirements of vendors who require some assurance that their fonts
						cannot be extracted simply by unzipping the [=OCF ZIP container=] and copying the resource.</p>

					<p>Obfuscation, like any protection scheme, cannot fully protect fonts from being accessed in their
						deobfuscated state. The mechanism only provides an obstacle for those who are unaware of the
						license details. It will not prevent a determined user from gaining full access to the font
						through such alternative means as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>applying the deobfuscation algorithm to extract the raw font file;</li>
						<li>accessing the deobfuscated font through a [=reading system=] that must deobfuscate it to
							render the content (e.g., by accessing the resources through a browser-based reading
							system); or</li>
						<li>accessing the deobfuscated font through authoring tools that provide the visual rendering of
							the content.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>As a result, whether this method of obfuscation satisfies the requirements of individual font
						licenses remains a question for the licensor and licensee. [=EPUB creators=] are responsible for
						ensuring their use of obfuscation meets font licensing requirements.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators should also be aware that obfuscation may lead to interoperability issues in
						reading systems as reading systems are not required to deobfuscate fonts. As a result, the
						visual presentation of their publications may differ from reading system to reading system.</p>

					<p>Also note that the algorithm is restricted to obfuscating fonts. It is not intended as a
						general-purpose mechanism for obfuscating any resource in the EPUB container.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="obfus-keygen">
					<h4>Obfuscation key</h4>

					<p id="obfus-key-unique-id" data-tests="#ocf-font_obfuscation,#ocf-font_obfuscation-bis">[=EPUB
						creators=] MUST derive the key used in the obfuscation algorithm from the [=unique
						identifier=].</p>

					<p>All whitespace characters, as defined in <a data-cite="xml#sec-common-syn">section 2.3 of the XML
							1.0 specification</a> [[xml]], MUST be removed from this identifier — specifically, the
						Unicode code points <code>U+0020</code>, <code>U+0009</code>, <code>U+000D</code> and
							<code>U+000A</code>.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators MUST generate a SHA-1 digest of the UTF-8 representation of the resulting string as
						specified by the Secure Hash Standard [[fips-180-4]]. They can then use this digest as the key
						for the algorithm.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="obfus-algorithm">
					<h4>Obfuscation algorithm</h4>

					<p>The algorithm employed to obfuscate fonts consists of modifying the first 1040 bytes (~1KB) of
						the font file. (In the unlikely event that the font file is less than 1040 bytes, this process
						will modify the entire file.)</p>

					<p>To obfuscate the original data, store, as the first byte of the embedded font, the result of
						performing a logical exclusive or (XOR) on the first byte of the raw font file and the first
						byte of the <a href="#obfus-keygen">obfuscation key</a>.</p>

					<p>Repeat this process with the next byte of source and key and continue for all bytes in the key.
						At this point, the process continues starting with the first byte of the key and 21st byte of
						the source. Once 1040 bytes are encoded in this way (or the end of the source is reached),
						directly copy any remaining data in the source to the destination.</p>

					<p>[=EPUB creators=] MUST obfuscate fonts before compressing and adding them to the [=OCF ZIP
						container=]. Note that as obfuscation is not encryption, this requirement is not a violation of
						the one in <a href="#sec-container-metainf-encryption.xml"></a> to compress fonts before
						encrypting them.</p>

					<p>The following pseudo-code exemplifies the obfuscation algorithm.</p>

								catalogue an [=EPUB publication=] and make it available to a user (e.g., to present in a

							<p>to provide access to all rendering metadata needed to control the layout and display of
								the content (e.g., <a href="#sec-fxl-package">fixed-layout properties</a>).</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>The package document does not provide complex metadata encoding capabilities. If [=EPUB
						creators=] need to provide more detailed information, they can associate metadata records (e.g.,
						that conform to an international standard such as [[onix]] or are created for custom purposes)
						using the [^link^] element. This approach allows reading systems to process the metadata in its
						native form, avoiding the potential problems and information loss caused by translating to use
						the minimal package document structure.</p>

					<p id="core-metadata-reqs">In keeping with this philosophy, the package document only has the
						following minimal metadata requirements: it MUST contain the [[dcterms]] [^dc:title^],
						[^dc:identifier^], and [^dc:language^] elements together with the [[dcterms]]

					<p>The package document <strong>legacy</strong> features are retained from EPUB 2 only to allow
						[=EPUB creators=] to author content that can function, to some degree, in [=reading systems=]
						that only support EPUB 2 publications.</p>

					<p>These features were added primarily to address the overlap period as EPUB 3 reading systems were
						developed, as there was still a high probability at that time that users would be opening EPUB 3
						publications on EPUB 2 reading systems.</p>

					<p>As reading systems that only handle EPUB 2 publications are now rare, EPUB creators should
						consider the likelihood of their publications still being opened on these types of older devices
						before making the effort to add these legacy features.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>[=EPUB conformance checkers=] should not alert EPUB creators about the presence of legacy

					<p>Support for the HTML syntax is still an <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2715"
							>open issue</a> in the EPUB 3.4 revision. It is <b><i>at risk</i></b>, depending on authors'
						and implementers' feedback. This specification introduces it as a core media type and also
						minimally adds requirements for its authoring in this section to begin making readers aware of
						the proposed change.</p>

					<p>Much of this specification, and the Reading Systems specification [[epub-rs-34]], continues to
						refer only to XHTML content documents and their authoring requirements, a number of which need
						resolving (e.g., providing an <a href="#sec-epub-type-attribute">alternative to the
								<code>epub:type</code> attribute</a>). These references and requirements will be updated
						once it is clearer that support will definitely be added in this revision. Until then, the
						specification should be read as also supporting HTML wherever it currently refers to XHTML,
						despite the support inconsistencies.</p>

							respective underlying specifications ([[html]] and [[svg]]). When an EPUB content document
							contains scripting, this specification refers to it as a [=scripted content document=]. This
							label also applies to [=XHTML content documents=] that contain [[html]] [^form^]
							elements.</p>

						<p>The <a href="#scripted"><code>scripted</code> property</a> of the [=EPUB manifest |
							manifest=] <code>item</code> element is used to indicate that an EPUB content document is a
							scripted content document.</p>

						<p>When an [[html]] <code>script</code> element contains a <a data-cite="html#data-block">data
								block</a>&#160;[[html]], it does not represent scripted content.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>[[svg]] does not define data blocks as of publication, but the same exclusion would apply
								if a future update adds the concept.</p>
						</div>

						<p>[=EPUB creators=] should note that [=reading systems=] are required to behave as though a
							unique <a data-cite="html#origin">origin</a> [[html]] has been assigned to each [=EPUB
							publication=]. In practice, this means that it is not possible for scripts to share data
							between EPUB publications.</p>

						<p>Which <a href="#sec-scripted-context">context</a> a script is used in also determines the
							rights and restrictions that a reading system places on it (refer to <a
								data-cite="epub-rs-34#sec-scripted-content">Scripting</a> [[?epub-rs-34]] for more
							information).</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>Reading systems may render scripted content documents in a manner that disables other
								EPUB capabilities and/or provides a different rendering and user experience (e.g., by
								disabling pagination).</p>
						</div>

					<section id="sec-scripted-context">
						<h4>Scripting contexts</h4>

						<p>EPUB 3 defines two contexts for script execution:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><a href="#sec-scripted-container-constrained">container constrained</a> — when the
								execution of a script occurs within an [[html]] [^iframe^] element; and</li>
							<li><a href="#sec-scripted-spine">spine level</a> — when the execution of a script occurs
								directly within a [=top-level content document=].</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="note">
							<p>Scripts may execute in other contexts, but [=reading system=] support for these contexts
								is optional. For example, a scripted SVG document may be referenced from an [[html]]
								[^object^] element.</p>
							<p>Refer to the <a data-cite="epub-rs-34#sec-scripted-content">processing of scripts</a>
								[[epub-rs-34]] for more information.</p>
						</div>

						<p>Whether [=EPUB creators=] embed the code directly in a <code>script</code> element or
							reference it via the element's <code>src</code> attribute makes no difference to its
							executing context.</p>

						<p>Which context EPUB creators use for their scripts affects both what actions the scripts can
							perform and the likelihood of support in reading systems, as described in the following
							subsections.</p>

						<div class="note">

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>The [=EPUB navigation document=] is a <a href="#confreq-nav">mandatory component</a> of an [=EPUB
					publication=]. It allows [=EPUB creators=] to include a human- and machine-readable global
					navigation layer, thereby ensuring increased usability and accessibility for the user.</p>

				<p>The EPUB navigation document is a special type of [=XHTML content document=] that defines the <a
						href="#sec-nav-toc">table of contents</a> for [=reading systems=]. It may also include other
					specialized navigation elements, such as a <a href="#sec-nav-pagelist">page list</a> and a list of
					key <a href="#sec-nav-landmarks">landmarks</a>. These navigation elements have <a
						href="#sec-nav-def-model">additional restrictions</a> on their content to facilitate their
					processing.</p>

				<p>The EPUB navigation document is not exclusively for machine processing, however. There are no
					restrictions on the structure or content of the EPUB navigation document outside of the specialized
					navigation elements (i.e., EPUB creators can mark the rest of the document up like any other XHTML
					content document). As a result, it can also be part of the linear reading order, avoiding the need
					for duplicate tables of contents. EPUB creators can hide navigation elements that are only for
					machine processing (e.g., the page list) with the <a href="#sec-nav-doc-use-spine"
							><code>hidden</code> attribute</a>.</p>

				<p>Note that reading systems may strip scripting, styling, and HTML formatting as they generate
					navigational interfaces from information found in the EPUB navigation document, and this may make
					the result difficult to read. If EPUB creators require such formatting and functionality, then they
					should also include the EPUB navigation document in the [=EPUB spine | spine=]. The use of
					progressive enhancement techniques for scripting and styling of the navigation document will help
					ensure the content will retain its integrity when rendered in a non-browser context.</p>

				<h3>Using in the spine</h3>

				<p id="confreq-cd-nav-docprops-spine">As a conforming [=XHTML content document=], [=EPUB creators=] can
					include the EPUB navigation document in the [=EPUB spine | spine=].</p>

				<p id="confreq-nav-ol-style">When adding the navigation document to the spine, EPUB creators have to
					consider that any [=reading system=] processing of the document will not apply. In particular,
					although [=EPUB reading systems=] are <a data-cite="epub-rs-34#confreq-nav-ol-style">required to
						suppress list item numbering</a> [[epub-rs-34]] when presenting the EPUB navigation document
					outside of the spine (such as in dedicated navigation user interfaces provided by reading systems),
					this requirement does not apply to in-spine use. Consequently, if EPUB creators do not want HTML's
					default list item numbering when presenting the navigation document in the spine, they have to
					specify the alternative list styling using CSS.</p>

				<p>Similarly, it is often the case that not all of the navigation structures, or branches within them,
					are needed when the EPUB navigation document is presented in the spine. EPUB creators will often
					want to hide the <a href="#sec-nav-pagelist">page list</a> and <a href="#sec-nav-landmarks"
						>landmarks</a> navigation elements, for example, or trim the branches of the table of contents
					for books that have many levels of subsections.</p>

				<p>In these cases, EPUB creators are advised use the [[html]] [^html-global/hidden^] attribute to
					indicate which (if any) portions of the navigation data are excluded from rendering in the content
					flow. The <a data-cite="epub-rs-34#confreq-nav-hidden">the attribute has no effect</a>
					[[epub-rs-34]] on how reading systems render the navigation document outside of the spine.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>While the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-display"><code>display</code>
							property</a> [[csssnapshot]] controls the visual rendering of EPUB navigation documents in
						[=reading systems=] with [=viewports=], reading systems without viewports may not support CSS.
						The <code>hidden</code> attribute can be used together with the <code>display</code> property to
						maximize interoperability across all reading systems.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Hiding a nav element in spine">

			<h2>Layout rendering control</h2>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Not all rendering information can be expressed through the underlying technologies that EPUB is built
					upon. For example, although HTML with CSS provides powerful layout capabilities, those capabilities
					are limited to the scope of the document being rendered.</p>

				<p>This section defines properties that allow [=EPUB creators=] to express package-level rendering
					intentions (i.e., functionality that can only be implemented by the [=EPUB reading system=]). If a
					reading system supports the desired rendering, these properties enable the user to be presented the
					content as the EPUB creator optimally designed it.</p>

			<section id="sec-fixed-layouts">
				<h3>Fixed layouts</h3>

				<section id="fxl-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>[=EPUB publications=], unlike print books or PDF files, are designed to change. The content
						flows, or reflows, to fit the screen and to fit the needs of the user. As noted in <a
							data-cite="epub-overview-34#sec-rendering">Rendering and CSS</a> "content presentation
						adapts to the user, rather than the user having to adapt to a particular presentation of
						content." [[epub-overview-34]]</p>

					<p>But this principle does not work for all types of documents. Sometimes content and design are so
						intertwined it is not possible to separate them. Any change in appearance risks changing the
						meaning or losing all meaning. [=Fixed-layout documents=] give [=EPUB creators=] greater control
						over presentation when a reflowable EPUB is not suitable for the content.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators define fixed layouts using a <a href="#sec-fxl-package">set of package document
							properties</a> to control the rendering in [=reading systems=]. In addition, they set <a
							href="#sec-fxl-package">the dimensions of each fixed-layout document</a> in its respective
						[=EPUB content document=].</p>

					<div class="note" id="note-mechanisms">
						<p>EPUB 3 affords multiple mechanisms for representing fixed-layout content. When fixed-layout
							content is necessary, the EPUB creator's choice of mechanism will depend on many factors
							including desired degree of precision, file size, accessibility, etc. This section does not
							attempt to dictate the EPUB creator's choice of mechanism.</p>

						<p id="property-layout-global">When the <a href="#layout"><code>rendition:layout</code>
								property</a> is specified on a <code>meta</code> element, it indicates that the

						<dl class="variablelist">
							<dt id="def-layout-reflowable">reflowable</dt>

								<p>The content is not pre-paginated (i.e., [=reading systems=] apply dynamic pagination

							<dt id="def-layout-pre-paginated">pre-paginated</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The content is pre-paginated (i.e., reading systems produce exactly one page per
									[=EPUB spine | spine=] [^itemref^] when rendering).</p>
							</dd>
						</dl>

						<div class="note" id="uaag">
							<p>Reading systems typically restrict or deny the application of user or user agent style
								sheets to pre-paginated documents because dynamic style changes are likely to have

						<h5>Spread placement</h5>

						<p>When a [=reading system=] renders a [=synthetic spread=], the default behavior is to populate
							the spread by rendering the next [=EPUB content document=] in the next available unpopulated
							[=viewport=], where the next available viewport is determined by the given <a
								href="#attrdef-spine-page-progression-direction">page progression direction</a> or by
							local declarations within [=EPUB content documents=]. An [=EPUB creator=] MAY override this
							automatic population behavior and force reading systems to place a document in a particular
							viewport by specifying one of the following properties on its spine <code>itemref</code>
							element:</p>

						<dl>
							<dt id="page-spread-center">
								<code>rendition:page-spread-center</code></dt>
							<dd>The <code>rendition:page-spread-center</code> property is an alias of the <a
									href="#spread-none"><code>spread-none</code> property</a> for centering a spine
								item.</dd>

							<dt id="fxl-page-spread-left">
								<code>rendition:page-spread-left</code>
							</dt>
							<dd>The <code>rendition:page-spread-left</code> property is an alias of the <code><a
										href="#page-spread-left">page-spread-left</a></code> property for placing a
								spine item in the left-hand slot of a two-page spread.</dd>

							<dt id="fxl-page-spread-right">
								<code>rendition:page-spread-right</code>
							</dt>
							<dd>The <code>rendition:page-spread-right</code> property is an alias of the <code><a
										href="#page-spread-right">page-spread-right</a></code> property for placing a
								spine item in the right-hand slot of a two-page spread.</dd>
						</dl>

						<p>The <code>rendition:page-spread-center</code>, <code>rendition:page-spread-left</code>, and
								<code>rendition:page-spread-right</code> properties apply to both pre-paginated and
							reflowable content. They only apply when the reading system is creating synthetic
							spreads.</p>

						<p>Although EPUB creators often indicate to use a spread in certain device orientations, the
							content itself does not represent true spreads (i.e., two consecutive pages that reading
							systems must render side-by-side for readability, such as a two-page map). To indicate that
							two consecutive pages represent a true spread, EPUB creators SHOULD use the
								<code>rendition:page-spread-left</code> and <code>rendition:page-spread-right</code>
							properties on the [=EPUB spine | spine=] items for the two adjacent EPUB content documents,
							and omit the properties on spine items where one-up or two-up presentation is equally
							acceptable.</p>

						<p>EPUB creators MUST NOT declare more than one <code>rendition:page-spread-*</code> property,
							and/or their unprefixed equivalents, on any given spine item (e.g., it is valid to specify
							both "<code>rendition:page-spread-left page-spread-left</code>" in case reading systems only
							support one of properties).</p>

						<div class="note" id="note-page-spread-aliases">
							<p>The <code>rendition:page-spread-left</code> and <code>rendition:page-spread-right</code>
								properties were created to allow the use of a single vocabulary for all fixed-layout
								properties. EPUB creators can use either property set, but older reading systems might
								only recognize the unprefixed versions.</p>

							<p>The <code>rendition:page-spread-center</code> was created to make it easier for EPUB
								creators to understand the process of switching between two-page spreads and single
								centered pages. EPUB creators can use either <code>rendition:page-spread-center</code>
								or <code>spread-none</code> to disable spread behavior in reading systems.</p>

					<h4>The <code>rendition:flow</code> property</h4>

					<p>The <code>rendition:flow</code> property specifies the [=EPUB creator=] preference for how
						[=reading systems=] should handle content overflow. </p>

					<p id="property-flow-global">When the <a href="#flow"><code>rendition:flow</code> property</a> is
						specified on a <code>meta</code> element, it indicates the EPUB creator's global preference for
						overflow content handling (i.e., for all [=EPUB spine | spine=] items). EPUB creators MAY

						possible to specify whether consecutive [=EPUB content documents=] are to be rendered as a
						continuous scrolling view or whether each is to be rendered separately (i.e., with a dynamic
						page break between each).</p>

					<p>EPUB creators MUST use one of the following values with the <code>rendition:flow</code>

			<h2>Media overlays</h2>

			<section id="sec-overlays-introduction" class="informative">
				<h4>Introduction</h4>

				<p>Mainstream ebooks, educational tools and ebooks formatted for persons with print disabilities are
					some examples of works that contain synchronized audio narration. In EPUB 3, [=EPUB creators=] can
					create these types of books using media overlay documents to describe the timing for the
					pre-recorded audio narration and how it relates to the [=EPUB content document=] markup. The
					specification defines the file format for media overlays as a subset of [[smil3]], a W3C
					recommendation for representing synchronized multimedia information in XML.</p>

				<p>The text and audio synchronization enabled by media overlays provides enhanced accessibility for any
					user who has difficulty following the text of a traditional book. Media overlays also provide a
					continuous listening experience for readers who are unable to read the text for any reason,
					something that traditional audio embedding techniques cannot offer. They are even useful for
					purposes not traditionally considered accessibility concerns (e.g., for language learning).</p>

				<p>The media overlays feature is transparent to [=EPUB reading systems=] that do not support the
					feature. The inclusion of media overlays in an [=EPUB publication=] has no impact on the ability of
					media overlay-unaware reading systems to render the EPUB publication as though the media overlays
					are not present.</p>

				<p>Media overlays in EPUB are not an equivalent to audiobooks, as audiobooks are primarily audio-based
					with text occasionally provided as an alternate format. The W3C [[audiobooks]] recommendation is for
					building audio publications.</p>

				<p>Although future versions of this specification might incorporate support for video media (e.g.,
					synchronized text/sign-language books), this version supports only synchronizing audio media with
					the EPUB content document.</p>

				<h3>Creating media overlays</h3>

				<section id="sec-docs-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>[=EPUB creators=] can represent a pre-recorded narration of a publication as a series of audio
						clips, each corresponding to part of an [=EPUB content document=]. A single audio clip, for
						example, typically represents a single phrase or paragraph, but infers no order relative to the
						other clips or to the text of a document. Media overlays solve this problem of synchronization
						by tying the structured audio narration to its corresponding text (or other media) in the EPUB
						content document using [[smil3]] markup. Media overlays are, in fact, a simplified subset of
						SMIL 3.0 that define the playback sequence of these clips.</p>

					<p>The SMIL elements primarily used for structuring media overlays are [^body^] (used for the main
						sequence), [^seq^] (sequence) and [^par^] (parallel). (Refer to <a href="#sec-overlays-def"></a>
						for more information on these and other SMIL elements.)</p>

					<p>The <code>par</code> element is the basic building block of a media overlay and corresponds to a
						phrase in the EPUB content document. The element provides two key pieces of information for
						synchronizing content: 1) the audio clip containing the narration for the phrase; and 2) a
						pointer to the associated EPUB content document fragment. The <code>par</code> element uses two

					<h4>Relationship to the EPUB content document</h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>In this section, the [=EPUB content document=] is assumed to be an [=XHTML content
							document=]. While [=EPUB creators=] may use media overlays with [=SVG content documents=],
							playback behavior might not be consistent and therefore interoperability is not
							guaranteed.</p>

						<p>EPUB creators should also be aware that [=reading system=] support for playback of both
							reflowable and fixed-layout EPUB content documents is not guaranteed. Differences in reading
							system pagination strategies mean that some reading systems will only support media overlays
							in one or the other layout format.</p>
					</div>

					<section id="sec-media-overlays-structure">
						<h5>Overlay structure</h5>

						<p>The [^body^] of a [=media overlay document=] consists of two elements: the [^par^] element
							and the [^seq^] element. The ordering of these elements represents how [=reading systems=]
							render the content in the corresponding [=EPUB content documents=] during playback.</p>

						<p>The <code>par</code> element represents a segment of content, such as a word, phrase,
							sentence, table cell, list item, image, or other identifiable piece of content in the
							markup. Each element identifies both the content to display (in the [^text^] element) and
							audio to synchronize (in the [^audio^] element) during playback.</p>

						<p>The <code>seq</code> element represents sequences — sets of <code>seq</code> and/or
								<code>par</code> elements that together represent a logical component of the content.
							[=EPUB creators=] can use it to represent nested containers such as sections, asides,
							headers, tables, lists, and footnotes. It allows EPUB creators to retain the structure
							inherent in these containers in the media overlay document.</p>

						<p>The <code>seq</code> element MUST contain an <a href="#attrdef-body-textref"
									><code>epub:textref</code> attribute</a>. As <code>seq</code> elements do not
							provide synchronization instructions, this attribute allows a [=reading system=] to match
							the fragment to a location in the text.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>The reason for grouping structures like sections, figures, tables, and footnotes in a
									<code>seq</code> element is so that reading systems can identify their start and end
								positions during playback. Reading systems can then offer playback options tailored to
								the layout of the content, such as jumping past a long figure, turning off rendering of
								page break announcements (see <a href="#sec-behaviors-skip-escape"></a>), or customizing
								the reading mode to suit structures such as tables.</p>

						<h5>Referencing document fragments</h5>

						<p>Both the <code>epub:textref</code> attribute and the [^text^] element's <code>src</code>
							attribute may contain a [=URL-fragment string=] that references a specific part (e.g., an
							element via its ID) of the associated [=EPUB content document=].</p>

						<p>For [=XHTML content document | XHTML=] and [=SVG content documents=], the URL-fragment string
							SHOULD be a reference to a specific element via its ID, or an <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/linking.html#SVGFragmentIdentifiers">SVG Fragment
								Identifier</a> [[svg]], respectively.</p>

					</section>

					<section id="sec-media-overlays-granularity" class="informative">
						<h5>Overlay granularity</h5>

						<p>The granularity level of the media overlay depends on how [=EPUB creators=] mark up the
							[=EPUB content document=] and the type of fragment identifier they use in the [^text^]
							elements' <code>src</code> attributes and the [^seq^] elements' <code>epub:textref</code>
							attributes. For example, when referencing [[html]] elements, if the finest level of markup
							is at the paragraph level, then that is the finest possible level for media overlay
							synchronization. Likewise, if sub-paragraph markup is available, such as [[html]] [^span^]
							element representing phrases or sentences, then finer granularity is possible in the media
							overlay. Finer granularity gives users more precise results for synchronized playback when
							navigating by word or phrase and when searching the text but increases the file size of the
							[=media overlay documents=]. Fragment identifier schemes that do not rely on the presence of
							elements could provide even finer granularity, where supported.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-tts">
						<h5>Text-to-speech rendering</h5>

						<p>This specification allows the use of text-to-speech (TTS) — the rendering of the textual
							content of an [=EPUB publication=] as artificial human speech using a synthesized voice — in
							addition to pre-recorded audio clips.</p>

						<p>When a media overlay [^par^] element omits its [^audio^] element, its [^text^] element may be
							rendered in reading systems via TTS. If the text fragment is not appropriate for TTS
							rendering (e.g., is not a text element and/or has no text fallback), this may produce
							unexpected results.</p>

					<h4>Associating style information</h4>

					<p>[=EPUB creators=] MAY express visual rendering information for the currently playing [=EPUB
						content document=] element in a CSS Style Sheet using author-defined classes.</p>

					<p>When used, EPUB creators MUST declare the class names in the [=package document=] using the <a
							href="#active-class"><code>active-class</code></a> and <a href="#playback-active-class"
								><code>playback-active-class</code></a> properties.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators MUST define exactly one CSS class name in each property they define. Each property
						MUST define a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#characters">valid CSS class
							name</a> not including any <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html">selectors</a>
						[[css2]]. This specification <strong>does not</strong> reserve names for use with these
						properties.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators MAY define any CSS properties for the specified CSS classes but must ensure that
						each EPUB content document with an associated [=media overlay document=] includes a CSS
						stylesheet (either embedded or linked) containing the class definitions. In the absence of such
						definitions [=reading systems=] might provide their own styling, or no styling at all.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators MUST NOT use the <code>active-class</code> and <code>playback-active-class</code>
						properties in conjunction with a <a href="#attrdef-refines"><code>refines</code> attribute</a>
						as they always apply to the entire [=EPUB publication=].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Associating style information with the
						currently playing EPUB content document">

						<p>The author-defined CSS class names are declared using the metadata properties <a

         my-document-playing
      &lt;/meta&gt;
      …
   &lt;/metadata&gt;
   …
&lt;/package&gt;</pre>

						<p>The CSS Style Sheet containing the author-defined class names:</p>

						<pre>/* emphasize the active element */
.my-active-item {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: black !important;
}

/* fade out the inactive text */
html.my-document-playing * {
    color: gray;

						<p>The relevant EPUB content document excerpt:</p>

						<pre>&lt;html&gt;
   …
   &lt;body&gt;
      …
      &lt;span id="txt1"&gt;
         This is the first phrase.

      &lt;span id="txt2"&gt;
         This is the second phrase.
      &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

						<p>In this example, the reading system would apply the author-defined
								<code>my-active-item</code> class to each text element in the EPUB content document as
							it became active during playback. Conversely, reading systems would remove the class name
							when the element is no longer active. The user would see each EPUB content document element
							styled with a yellow background for the duration of that element's playback.</p>

						<p>The reading system would also apply the author-defined <code>my-document-playing</code> class
							to the document element of the EPUB content document when media overlays playback begins.
							The reading system would remove the class name when playback stops. In the case of an
							[=XHTML content document=], the reading system would apply the class name to the [^html^]
							element [[?html]]. In the case of an [=SVG content document=], the reading system would
							apply the class name to the [^svg^] element [[svg]]. The user would see all the inactive
							text elements turn gray during media overlays playback. When playback stopped, the elements'

					<h4>Escapability</h4>

					<p>Escapable items are nested structures, such as tables and lists, that users might wish to skip
						over, continuing to read from the point immediately after the nested structure. The escapability
						feature differs from the skippability feature in that it does not enable or disable entire types
						of items, but provides an exit from them (e.g., a user can listen to some of the content before
						choosing to escape).</p>

					<p>[=EPUB creators=] MAY use the following semantics to enable escapability:</p>

				<ul>

						<p>When included in the spine, playback of the EPUB navigation document's media overlay document

			<h2>Accessibility</h2>

			<p>EPUB 3 builds upon the Open Web Platform expressly so that it can leverage the structure, semantics and,
				by extension, accessibility built into its underlying technologies.</p>

			<p>The requirements and practices for creating accessible web content have already been documented in the
				W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> [[wcag2]].
				These guidelines also form the basis for defining accessibility in [=EPUB publications=].</p>

			<p>As the current WCAG guidelines (version 2) are heavily focused on web pages, a separate specification, <a
					data-cite="epub-a11y-111#">EPUB Accessibility</a> [[epub-a11y-111]], defines how to apply the
				standard to EPUB publications. It also adds EPUB-specific requirements and recommendations for metadata,
				pagination, and media overlays.</p>

			<p>This specification recommends that EPUB publications <a href="#confreq-a11y">conform to the accessibility
					requirements</a> defined in&#160;[[epub-a11y-111]]. A benefit of following this recommendation is
				that it helps to ensure that EPUB publications meet the accessibility requirements legislated in
				jurisdictions around the world.</p>

			<p>[=EPUB creators=], however, should look beyond legal imperatives and treat accessibility as a requirement
				for all their content. The more accessible that EPUB publications are, the greater the potential
				audience for them.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>This specification does not integrate the accessibility requirements to allow them to adapt and
					evolve independent of the EPUB specification — accessibility practices often need more frequent
					updating. The accessibility specification is also intended for use with past, present, and future
					versions of EPUB. The approach of a separate specification ensures that the evolution of EPUB does
					not lock accessibility in time (i.e., it allows producers of older versions of EPUB to reference the
					latest accessibility requirements).</p>

			<h2>Security and privacy</h2>

			<section id="security-privacy-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The particularity of an [=EPUB publication=] is its structure. The EPUB format provides a means of
					representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced web
					content&#160;—&#160;including HTML, CSS, SVG, JavaScript, and other resources&#160;—&#160;for
					distribution in a single-file container.</p>

				<p>This means that EPUB 3's security and privacy issues are primarily linked to the features of those
					formats, and closely mirror the threats presented by web content.</p>

				<p>Although content risks are often equated with deliberately malicious authoring intent, [=EPUB
					creators=] need to be aware that many practices followed with the best of intentions may expose
					users to privacy and security issues. The rest of this section explores the risk model of EPUB 3
					with the aim of helping EPUB creators recognize and mitigate these risks.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For the risks associated with [=reading systems=], refer to the <a

				</div>

			<section id="epub-threat-model" class="informative">
				<h3>Threat model</h3>

				<p>[=EPUB publications=] pose a variety of privacy and security threats to unsuspecting users. Many of
					these threats intersect with web content, but EPUB also introduces its own unique methods of attack
					that can be used to trick users into accessing malicious content or into providing sensitive
					information. Some of the more important attack vectors that [=EPUB creators=] and users need to be
					aware of include:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Embedding of remote resources</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>EPUB 3 allows some [=publication resources=] to be <a href="#sec-resource-locations">remotely
								hosted</a>, specifically resources whose sizes can negatively affect the downloading and
							opening of the EPUB publication (e.g., audio, video, and fonts). Although helpful for users
							when used as intended, these exemptions can also be used to inject malicious content into a
							publication.</p>
						<p>This threat is not limited to accessing content created by a bad actor. If EPUB creators
							embed content from untrustworthy sources (e.g., third party audio and video), there is
							always the possibility that users may receive compromised resources.</p>
						<p>Checking for malware and exploits at distribution time is not always reliable, either, as the
							malicious content can be swapped in any time after publication, unlike resources that come
							embedded in the [=EPUB container=].</p>
						<p>The <a href="#sec-container-iri">origin</a> of an EPUB is both unknown to the EPUB creator
							and specific to each reading system implementation. Consequently, if the EPUB creator hosts
							[=remote resources=] on a web server they control, the server effectively cannot use

						<p>Whether intentional or not, links to external web sites and resources expose users to

							model, this does not protect users from all exploits.</p>
						<p>Even if the intentions of the EPUB creator are not malicious, adding tracking information to

					<h4>EPUB-specific features</h4>

					<p>EPUB 3 tries to avoid extending the underlying technologies it builds on, but it has introduced
						some new features. The restricted scope of these features limits the threats they might pose,
						however:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p><a href="#sec-xhtml-content-switch">Content switching</a> and <a
									href="#sec-xhtml-epub-trigger">multimedia control elements</a> only allow hiding of
								content and script-less control of playback in HTML. Moreover, these features,
								introduced in the first release of EPUB 3.0, are <a href="#deprecated">deprecated</a>
								and no longer recommended for use.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The <a href="#sec-epub-type-attribute">expression of structural semantics</a> in HTML and
								SVG only allows the annotation of elements.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The one potential exception is the <a data-cite="epub-rs-34#app-epubReadingSystem"
								><code>epubReadingSystem</code> object</a> [[epub-rs-34]] that allows [=EPUB creators=]
						to query information about the current [=reading system=]. EPUB creators need to be mindful that
						they only use the information exposed by this object to improve the rendering of their content
						(i.e., avoid using the information to profile the user and their environment).</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="security-privacy-recommendations">
				<h3>Recommendations</h3>

				<p>Although [=EPUB creators=] cannot prevent every method of exploiting users, they are ultimately
					responsible for the secure construction of their content. That means that they need to take
					precautions to limit the exposure of their [=EPUB publications=] to the types of <a
						href="#epub-threat-model">malicious exploits</a> described in the previous section.</p>

				<p>Some practical steps include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Ensuring the use of stable links to [=remote resources=].</li>
					<li>Avoiding third-party resources, especially those hosted on servers outside the control of the
						EPUB creator.</li>
					<li>Avoiding links to untrustworthy web sites (e.g., that browsers do not recognize as safe).</li>
					<li>Using secure connections to external sites and resources (i.e., using the HTTPS protocol).</li>
					<li>Not using scripts to send or receive data over the network without the consent of the user.</li>
					<li>Obtaining user consent for the use of Web APIs with privacy implications, such as <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/">Geolocation</a> [[geolocation]] and <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/">Push Notifications</a> [[push-api]].</li>
					<li>Avoiding embedding content not provided by reputable organizations or individuals.</li>
					<li>Avoiding deprecated features of EPUB due to the potential for undiscovered bugs in
						implementations.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>EPUB creators also need to consider the privacy rights of users and avoid situations where they are
					intentionally collecting data. Ideally, EPUB creators SHOULD NOT track their users, but this is not
					realistic for all types of publishing.</p>

				<p>When EPUB creators have to track users, they SHOULD obtain the approval of the user to collect
					information prior to opening the EPUB publication (e.g., in educational course work). If this is not
					possible, they SHOULD obtain permission when users access the EPUB publication for the first time.
					EPUB creators SHOULD also allow users to opt out of tracking, and provide users the ability to
					manage and delete any data that is collected about them.</p>

				<p>EPUB creators also need to consider the inadvertent collection of information about users. Linking to
					content on a publisher's web site, or remotely hosting resources on their servers, can lead to
					profiling users, especially if unique tracking identifiers are added to the URLs.</p>

				<p>When collecting and storing user information within an EPUB publication (e.g., through the use of <a
						data-cite="html#dom-document-cookie">cookies</a> and <a data-cite="html#webstorage">web
						storage</a> [[?html]]), EPUB creators need to consider to potential for data theft by other EPUB
					publications on a [=reading system=]. Although [[epub-rs-34]] introduces a <a
						data-cite="epub-rs-34#sec-container-iri">unique origin requirement</a> for EPUB publications,
					which limits the potential for attacks, there is still a risk that reading systems will allow EPUB
					publications access to shared persistent storage (e.g., older reading systems that have not been
					updated and non-conforming newer reading systems). Consequently, EPUB creators SHOULD NOT store
					sensitive user data in persistent storage. If EPUB creators must store sensitive data, they SHOULD
					encrypt the data to prevent trivial access to it in the case of an exploit.</p>

				<p>When publishers and vendors must use digital rights management schemes, they should prefer schemes
					that do not utilize or transmit information about the user or their content to external parties to
					perform encryption or decryption.</p>

				<p>To maximally reduce security and privacy risks, EPUB creators SHOULD produce their EPUB publications
					with the goal of long-term preservation. EPUB publications created this way are normally
					self-contained, not dependent on network access, and not encrypted with digital rights management,
					removing many of the possible attack vectors. [[?iso22424]] is an example of such a preservation
					format for EPUB publications. While it is understood that not all EPUB creators can achieve these
					levels of self-containment, following as many of these practices as possible will still benefit
					overall user privacy and security.</p>

			<h2>Expressing structural semantics</h2>

			<section id="sec-structural-semantics-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Structural semantics add additional meaning about the specific structural purpose an element plays.
					The [^/epub:type^] attribute is used to express domain-specific semantics in [=EPUB content
					documents=] and [=media overlay documents=], with the structural information it carries
					complementing the underlying vocabulary.</p>

				<p>The applied semantics refine the meaning of their containing elements without changing their nature
					for assistive technologies, as happens when using the similar [^/role^] attribute&#160;[[html]]. The
					attribute does not enhance the accessibility of the content, in other words; it only provides hints
					about the purpose.</p>

				<p>Semantic metadata enriches content for use in publishing workflows and for author-defined purposes.
					It also allows [=reading systems=] to learn more about the structure and content of a document
					(e.g., to enable <a href="#sec-behaviors-skip-escape">skippability and escapability</a> in media
					overlays).</p>

				<p>This specification defines a method for adding structural semantics using <em>the attribute
					axis</em>: instead of adding new elements, [=EPUB creators=] can append the <code>epub:type</code>
					attribute to existing elements to add the desired semantics.</p>

					<p>Support for an HTML serialization of the <code>epub:type</code> attribute depends on the addition
						of support for the <a href="#sec-xhtml">HTML syntax</a> in the EPUB 3.4 revision. It is <b><i>at
								risk</i></b>, depending on authors' and implementers' feedback.</p>

					<p>The proposed <code>epub-type</code> will provide similar functionality for HTML content documents
						but with some restrictions (namely, no extensibility through the <code>epub:prefix</code>
						attribute). The attribute should be read as a replacement for <code>epub:type</code> where this
						specification and the Reading Systems specification [[epub-rs-34]] refer to that attribute for
						XHTML content documents. These references will be updated once it is clearer that support will
						definitely be added in this revision.</p>

					<p>The <code>epub:type</code> attribute will remain the sole means of including semantics in XML
						grammars in EPUB (i.e., XHTML content documents, SVG content documents, and media overlay
						documents).</p>

					<p>To provide feedback on this change, please open issues in the <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues">GitHub tracker for the EPUB
							specifications</a>.</p>
				</div>


				<div class="caution">
					<p>Although the <code>epub:type</code> attribute is similar in nature to the [^/role^]
						attribute&#160;[[html]], the attributes serve different purposes. The values of the
							<code>epub:type</code> attribute do not enhance access through assistive technologies like
						screen readers as they do not map to the accessibility <abbr
							title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> used by these technologies. This
						means that adding <code>epub:type</code> values to semantically neutral elements like [[html]]
						[^div^] and [^span^] does not make them any more accessible to assistive technologies. Only ARIA
						roles influence how assistive technologies understand such elements.</p>

					<p>The <code>epub:type</code> attribute is consequently only intended for publishing semantics and
						[=reading system=] enhancements. Reading systems may use <code>epub:type</code> values to
						provide accessibility enhancements like built-in read aloud or media overlays functionality
						where interaction with assistive technologies is not essential.</p>

					<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria/">Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA
						Module</a>&#160;[[?dpub-aria]] for more information about accessible publishing roles.</p>
				</div>

				<p>The <code>epub:type</code> attribute inflects semantics on the element on which it appears. Its value
					is one or more whitespace-separated terms stemming from external vocabularies associated with the
					document instance.</p>

				<p>The <a href="#sec-default-vocab">default vocabulary</a> for the <code>epub:type</code> attribute is
					the EPUB&#160;3 Structural Semantics Vocabulary&#160;[[?epub-ssv-11]]. The prefix URL for
					referencing its properties is <code>http://idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/#</code>.</p>

				<p>EPUB creators MAY include unprefixed terms that are not part of this vocabulary, but the preferred
					method for adding custom semantics is to use <a href="#sec-prefix-attr">prefixes</a> for them. Refer
					to <a href="#sec-vocab-assoc"></a> for more information.</p>

			<h2>Vocabularies</h2>

			<p>This appendix defines a general set of mechanisms by which attributes in this specification can reference
				terms from vocabularies. It also defines EPUB-specific vocabularies for use with the attributes.</p>

			<section id="sec-vocab-assoc">
				<h3>Vocabulary association mechanisms</h3>

				<section id="sec-vocab-assoc-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>EPUB defines a formal method of referencing terms and properties defined in metadata and semantic
						vocabularies using the <a href="#sec-property-datatype"><var>property</var> data type</a>. The
							<code>epub:type</code> attribute uses this data type in [=EPUB content documents=] and
						[=media overlay documents=] to add <a href="#app-structural-semantics">structural semantics</a>,
						for example, while the <code>property</code> and <code>rel</code> attributes use the data type
						to define properties and relationships in the [=package document=].</p>

					<p>A <var>property</var> value is like a CURIE [[rdfa-core]] — it represents a URL [[url]] in
						compact form. The expression consists of a prefix and a reference, where the prefix — whether
						literal or implied — is a shorthand mapping of a URL that typically resolves to a term
						vocabulary. When a [=reading system=] converts the prefix to its URL representation and combines
						with the reference, the resulting URL normally resolves to a fragment within that vocabulary
						that contains human- and/or machine-readable information about the term.</p>

					<p>To reduce the complexity for authoring, each attribute that takes a <var>property</var> data type
						also defines a <a href="#sec-default-vocab">default vocabulary</a>. Terms and properties
						referenced from the default vocabularies do not include a prefix as the mapping reading systems
						use to map to a URL is predefined.</p>

					<p>The power of the <var>property</var> data type lies in its easy extensibility. To incorporate new
						terms and properties, [=EPUB creators=] only need to declare a <a href="#sec-prefix-attr"
							>prefix</a>. In another authoring convenience, this specification also <a
							href="#sec-metadata-reserved-prefixes">reserves prefixes</a> for many commonly used
						publishing vocabularies (i.e., their declaration is optional).</p>

					<p>The following sections provide additional details on the <var>property</var> data type and
						vocabulary association mechanism.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-property-datatype">
					<h4>The <var>property</var> data type</h4>

					<p>The <var>property</var> data type is a compact means of expressing a URL [[url]] and consists of
						an OPTIONAL prefix separated from a reference by a colon.</p>

					<p>This specification derives the <var>property</var> data type from the CURIE data type defined in
						[[rdfa-core]]. A <var>property</var> represents a subset of CURIEs.</p>

					<p>There are two key differences from CURIEs, however:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>an empty <var>reference</var> does not represent a valid <var>property</var> value even
								though it is valid to the definition above (i.e., a <var>property</var> value that only
								consists of a prefix and colon is invalid).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an empty string does not represent a valid <var>property</var> even though it is valid to
								the definition above.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="example" title="Expanding a metadata property value">
						<p>In this example, the <var>property</var> value is composed of the prefix <code>dcterms</code>
							and the reference <code>modified</code>.</p>

						<pre>&lt;meta property="dcterms:modified"&gt;2011-01-01T12:00:00Z&lt;/meta&gt;</pre>

						<p>After <a data-cite="epub-rs-34#sec-property-values">processing</a> [[epub-rs-34]], this
							property would expand to the following URL:</p>

						<pre class="nohighlight">http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified</pre>

						<p>as the <code>dcterms:</code> prefix is a <a href="#sec-metadata-reserved-prefixes">reserved
								prefix</a> that maps to the URL "<code>http://purl.org/dc/terms/</code>".</p>
					</aside>

					<p>When an [=EPUB creator=] omits a prefix from a <var>property</var> value, the expressed reference
						represents a term from the <a href="#sec-default-vocab">default vocabulary</a> for that
						attribute.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expanding a manifest property value">
						<p>In this example, the <a href="#mathml"><code>mathml</code> property</a> is specified on a

						<p>This property expands to:</p>

						<pre>http://idpf.org/epub/vocab/package/item/#mathml</pre>

						<p>when the prefix URL for the vocabulary is concatenated with the reference.</p>

				<p>The syntax of this grammar is also influenced by the parsing algorithm for the <code>viewport
						meta</code> tag, as defined in [[css-viewport-1]].</p>

				<p>The syntax is intentionally left as generic as possible as it is not in this specification's scope to
					define all the possible properties and values. It only defines the basic requirements for defining a

				<p>The only restriction on property <a href="#viewport.ebnf.name">names</a> and <a

				<p>The authoring requirements in this section apply <em>after</em>
					<a data-cite="xml#AVNormalize">whitespace normalization</a>&#160;[[xml]] (i.e., after a reading
					system strips leading and trailing whitespace and compacts all instances of multiple whitespace
					within the attribute to single spaces). EPUB creators MAY include any <a data-cite="xml#NT-S"
