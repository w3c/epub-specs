			<p>This specification specifies content conformance requirements for verifying the accessibility of EPUB®
				Publications. It also specifies accessibility metadata requirements for the discoverability of EPUB
				publications.</p>

		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>This specification, EPUB Accessibility, addresses two key needs in the EPUB ecosystem:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>discoverability of the accessible qualities of <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publications</a>; and</li>
					<li>evaluation and certification of accessible EPUB publications.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The provision of accessibility metadata facilitates informed decisions about the usability of an EPUB
					publication. Consumers can review the qualities of the content and decide whether an EPUB
					publication is appropriate for their needs, regardless of whether it meets the bar of accessible
					certification. At a minimum, all EPUB publications that conform to this specification meet the
					accessibility metadata requirements described in <a href="#sec-discovery"></a>.</p>

				<p>Although creating EPUB publications with a high degree of accessibility has always been possible,
					this specification sets formal requirements for certifying content accessible. These requirements
					provide a clear set of guidelines to evaluate content against and allow certification of quality. An
					accessible EPUB publication is one that meets the accessibility requirements described in <a
						href="#sec-accessible-pubs"></a>.</p>

				<p>The specification also discusses the practice of optimizing EPUB publications for specific reading
					modalities. In these cases, although the content cannot meet the broad accessibility requirements of
					this specification, if the publications follow the discoverability and reporting requirements they
					can improve the ability of users to determine if the content still meets their needs. Refer to <a
						href="#sec-optimized-pubs"></a> for more information.</p>

				<p>The specification also addresses the impact of distribution on the accessibility and discoverability
					of content in <a href="#sec-distribution"></a>.</p>

				<p>This specification does not target a single version of EPUB. It is applicable to EPUB publications
					that conform to any version or profile, including future versions of the standard.</p>

				<p>Ideally, these guidelines help evaluate any digital publication built on Open Web Platform
					technologies, although ensuring such application is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For additional background on the decisions that went into this specification, refer to <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/docs/a11y-faq/">EPUB Accessibility Frequently Asked
							Questions</a>.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-success-techniques" class="informative">
				<h3>Success techniques</h3>

				<p>This specification takes an abstract approach to the accessibility requirements for <a
						data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>, similar to how WCAG [[wcag2]]
					separates its accessibility guidelines from the techniques to achieve them. This approach allows the
					guidelines to remain stable even as the format evolves.</p>

				<p>To facilitate this approach, the companion <a data-cite="epub-a11y-tech-12#">EPUB Accessibility
						Techniques</a> [[epub-a11y-tech-12]] document outlines conformance techniques. These techniques
					explain how to meet the requirements of this specification for different versions of EPUB.</p>

				<section id="sec-sc-i18n">
					<h4>Internationalization</h4>

					<p>This specification is also designed to address the accessibility needs of users independent of
						what languages they read. The same is true for the principles and success criteria defined in
						[[wcag2]]. The goal is to ensure that users can fully consume the information of a publication
						regardless of their preferred reading modality.</p>

					<p>At the same time, the language and writing conventions of the authored text will influence the
						techniques necessary to meet the accessibility requirements. EPUB <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#confreq-xml-enc">requires support for Unicode text</a>
						[[epub]], for example, which ensures the correct character data can be used (i.e., avoiding the
						need to use images of text). Although this is an important feature, it is often not enough on
						its own to ensure that the text is fully accessible in any given language (e.g., additional
						information about directionality, emphasis, pronunciation, etc. may also be needed).</p>

					<p>As a consequence, there may be language- or culture-specific practices for meeting accessibility
						requirements. Whether these practices are defined within this specification and its techniques
						or elsewhere (e.g., in WCAG techniques or language-specific best practice recommendations) will
						depend on whether the issues are specific to EPUB or broadly affect all web content.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-application" class="informative">
				<h3>Application to older versions of EPUB</h3>

				<p>This specification is applicable to any <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
						publication</a>, regardless of what version of EPUB it conforms to.</p>

				<p>For example, even though EPUB 2 [[opf-201]] was produced before this specification, and so makes no
					mention of it, it is possible to create EPUB 2 publications that conform to the accessibility and
					discoverability requirements. Ideally, though, EPUB 2 publications will be upgraded to the latest
					version of EPUB 3 to get access to the most advanced accessibility features and techniques.</p>

				<p>Note that not all metadata expressions defined in this specification are supported in EPUB 2 as it
					does not have an equivalent to the <a data-cite="epub/#attrdef-refines"><code>refines</code>
						attribute</a> [[epub]]. If metadata expressions that require a <code>refines</code> attribute
					cannot be avoided, there will be a certain amount of ambiguity in the statements (i.e.,
					relationships between expression may only be apparent by their placement in the package document
					metadata).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This specification uses <a data-cite="epub/#sec-terminology">terminology defined in EPUB 3</a>
					[[epub]].</p>

				<p>It also defines the following term:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>
						<dfn id="dfn-assistive-technology" data-lt="assistive technologies">assistive technology</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This specification uses the <a data-cite="wcag2#dfn-assistive-technologies">definition of
								assistive technology</a> from [[wcag2]].</p>
						<p>In the case of EPUB, an assistive technology is not always a separate application from a <a
								data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a>. Reading systems often
							integrate features of standalone assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech
							playback.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section links to its definition.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="conformance"></section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-discovery">
			<h2>Discoverability</h2>

			<section id="sec-disc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Unlike web pages, <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> are distributed
					through many channels for personal consumption — a model that has made EPUB a successful format for
					ebooks and other types of digital publications. A consequence of this model, however, is that
					specific details about the accessibility of a publication must travel with it.</p>

				<p>An online bookstore aggregating content from publishers and authors, for example, does not know the
					production quality that went into each submission unless the publisher informs them through
					metadata.</p>

				<p>Ensuring that any interested party can discover the accessible qualities of an EPUB publication is
					therefore a primary concern. An EPUB publication can have more than one set of sufficient <a
						href="#confreq-schema-accessMode">access modes</a> depending on the alternatives provided to
					enable reading in another mode. For example, if alternative text and descriptions are provided for
					all the images in a publication, it would have both its default textual and visual sufficient access
					mode <em>and</em> a purely textual sufficient access mode.</p>

				<p>Similarly, content that does not meet the accessibility requirements of this specification does not
					necessarily fail to meet the needs of individual users.</p>

				<p>Only through the provision of rich metadata can a user decide if the content is suitable for
					them.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-disc-package">
				<h3>Package metadata</h3>

				<p>All <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> MUST include [[schema-org]]
					accessibility metadata in the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> that
					exposes their accessible properties, regardless of whether the publications also meet the <a
						href="#sec-accessible-pubs">accessibility</a> or <a href="#sec-optimized-pubs">optimization</a>
					requirements.</p>

				<p>EPUB publications MUST include the following accessibility metadata:</p>

				<ul class="conformance-list">
					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessModeSufficient"><a href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"
								>accessModeSufficient</a> — a set of one or more access modes sufficient to consume the
							content without significant loss of information. An EPUB publication can have more than one
							set of sufficient access modes for its consumption depending on the types of content it
							includes (i.e., unlike <a href="#confreq-schema-accessMode">access modes</a>, this property
							takes into account any alternatives for content that is not broadly accessible, such as the
							inclusion of transcripts for audio content).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilityFeature"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"
								>accessibilityFeature</a> — features and adaptations that contribute to the overall
							accessibility of the content (e.g., alternative text, extended descriptions, captions).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilityHazard"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"
								>accessibilityHazard</a> — any potential hazards that the content presents (e.g.,
							flashing, motion simulation, sound).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>EPUB publications SHOULD include the following [[schema-org]] accessibility metadata:</p>

				<ul class="conformance-list">
					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessMode"><a href="https://schema.org/accessMode">accessMode</a> — a
							human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty necessary to process or perceive the
							content (e.g., textual, visual, auditory, tactile).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilitySummary"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary"
								>accessibilitySummary</a> — a human-readable summary of the accessibility that
							complements, but does not duplicate, the other discoverability metadata. The summary also
							describes any known deficiencies (e.g., lack of extended descriptions, specific
							hazards).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> MAY include additional [[schema-org]]
					accessibility metadata not specified in this section.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>This specification assumes that conformance and discoverability metadata will be processed and
						presented in a human-readable manner, removing the need for a summary unless there is additional
						information to express. Such processing is not available in all market segments, however,
						particularly in library systems. Consequently, that limitation will influence whether to include
						a summary and what to state in it.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Linked metadata records</h3>

				<p>Accessibility metadata can also be included in <a data-cite="epub/#sec-link-elem">linked records</a>

			<h2>Accessible publications</h2>

			<section id="sec-accessible-pubs-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>EPUB builds on the Open Web Platform, with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG the core technologies used
					for content authoring. Leveraging these technologies allows the authoring of <a
						data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> with a high degree of accessibility
					through the application of established web accessibility techniques, such as using native elements
					and controls whenever possible and enhancing custom interactive content with [[wai-aria]] roles,
					states, and properties. Plus, whenever possible, the EPUB community adds publishing accessibility
					needs to these standards &#8212; for example, through the creation of the [[dpub-aria-1.1]] role
					module. It is not necessary for anyone familiar with web accessibility to learn a new accessibility
					framework to make EPUB publications accessible.</p>

				<p>The primary source for producing accessible web content is the W3C's Web Content Accessibility
					Guidelines (WCAG) [[wcag2]], which establish benchmarks for accessible content. WCAG defines four
					high-level content principles — that content be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
					These principles are also central to creating accessible EPUB publications, so it is no surprise
					that this specification builds on the extensive work done in WCAG.</p>

				<p>This section defines <a href="#sec-acc-pub-wcag">how to apply the conformance criteria defined in
						WCAG</a> to EPUB publications. It also adds additional <a href="#sec-epub-req">requirements
						unique to EPUB publications</a>, and defines <a href="#sec-conf-reporting">conformance reporting
						requirements</a>.</p>

				<p>EPUB publications authored to comply with the requirements in this section will have a high degree of
					accessibility for users with a wide variety of reading needs and preferences.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-rel-wcag" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to WCAG</h3>

				<p>WCAG [[wcag2]] and its <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/">associated techniques</a>
					provide extensive coverage of issues and solutions for web content accessibility, covering
					everything from multimedia to interactive content to structured markup and more. They represent the
					foundation that this specification builds upon.</p>

				<p>This specification does not repeat the requirements or techniques introduced in those documents, as
					it risks breaking compatibility between the two standards (e.g., putting guidance out of sync, or in
					conflict). At the same time, although this specification does not call out those requirements, it
					does not diminish their importance in creating <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
						publications</a> that are accessible.</p>

				<p>This specification instead defines how to apply WCAG to an EPUB publication — which is a <a
						href="#sec-wcag-eval-page-pub">collection of web documents</a> as opposed to a single page — and
					adds an <a href="#sec-epub-req">additional set of requirements</a>. These requirements are no more
					or less important than those covered in WCAG; they are simply necessary to follow for EPUB
					publications. (Each requirement explains its relationship to WCAG in its respective section.)</p>

				<p>The same is true of the techniques in the EPUB Accessibility Techniques document
					[[epub-a11y-tech-12]]. It provides coverage of techniques that are unique to EPUB publications, or
					that need clarification in the context of an EPUB publication. It does not mean that the rest of the
					WCAG techniques are not applicable.</p>

				<p>As a result, although it is possible to read this section without deep knowledge of WCAG conformance,
					to implement the accessibility requirements of this specification requires an understanding of
					WCAG.</p>

				<p>Because this specification adds requirements that are not a part of WCAG, an EPUB publication can
					conform to WCAG without conforming to this specification.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-acc-pub-wcag">
				<h3>WCAG conformance</h3>

				<section id="sec-wcag-conf">
					<h4>WCAG conformance requirements</h4>

					<p>To conform to this specification, an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publication</a>:</p>

					<ul class="conformance-list">
						<li>
							<p id="confreq-wcag-20">MUST, at the minimum, meet the requirements of WCAG 2.0 [[wcag20]],
								but it is strongly RECOMMENDED that it meet the requirements of the <a
									data-cite="wcag2#">latest recommended version of WCAG 2</a>.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p id="confreq-wcag-a">MUST, for whichever version of WCAG 2 selected, meet the requirements
								of <a data-cite="wcag2#cc1_A">Level A</a>, but it is strongly RECOMMENDED that it meet
								the requirements of <a data-cite="wcag2#cc1_AA">Level AA</a>.</p>
							<div class="note">
								<p>Although conforming at <a data-cite="wcag2#cc1_AAA">level AAA</a> is not required by
									this specification, following the practices detailed in AAA success criteria when
									producing accessible EPUB publications is encouraged.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The reporting flexibility offered by these requirements is to ensure that this specification can
						be adapted for use in regions that mandate accessibility but without negating or superseding the
						requirements in effect in those regions.</p>

					<p>This specification sets the baseline requirement to WCAG 2.0 Level A, for example, primarily to
						provide backwards compatibility for older content and flexibility to encourage adoption of
						accessible production where no formal requirements exist. Most accessibility practitioners do
						not recognize this level as providing a high degree of accessibility, however.</p>

					<p>Ideally, EPUB publications will conform to the latest version of WCAG 2 at Level AA, but local
						and national laws, or procurer or distributor requirements, will define the formal thresholds
						they must meet.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Examples of legislative requirements for accessibility include the <a
								href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">Directive
								2019/882</a> in the European Union and <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/"
								>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> in the United States. EPUB
							publications will need to meet more than just the basic Level A success criteria to be
							compliant with these laws.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Keeping pace with WCAG has the benefit of continuously enhancing access for users. As web
						technologies change and improve, and awareness of conditions that impede access evolve, the
						standard adds new requirements. Meeting these additional requirements helps ensure EPUB
						publications employ the most up-to-date techniques. Meeting the requirements of older versions,
						while still helpful, can result in a less optimal reading experience.</p>

					<p>Similarly, legal frameworks and policies often cite Level AA conformance as the benchmark for
						accessibility as this level provides the greatest range of improvements that are realistic to
						implement. When only meeting Level A conformance, accessibility is compromised for various user
						groups, resulting in a less optimal reading experience.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/agwg/">W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working
								Group</a> is currently developing WCAG 3. As this version potentially represents a
							significant departure from WCAG 2, a future version of this specification will address
							conformance requirements related to it. Adoption of WCAG 3 is encouraged once it is stable
							and widely recognized, but conformance to the new version is not a requirement of this
							standard.</p>
					</div>

					<h4>Evaluating WCAG conformance</h4>

					<section id="sec-wcag-eval-page-pub">
						<h5>Page and publication</h5>

						<p>The WCAG <a data-cite="wcag2#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance">principles</a> [[wcag2]] focus on the
							evaluation of individual web pages, but an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
								publication</a> more closely resembles what WCAG refers to as a <a
								data-cite="wcag2#dfn-set-of-web-pages">set of web pages</a>: "[a] collection of web
							pages that share a common purpose" [[wcag2]].</p>

						<p>Consequently, when evaluating the accessibility of an EPUB publication, it is not possible to
							review individual pages — or EPUB content documents, as they are known in EPUB 3 — in
							isolation. Rather, the full EPUB publication MUST be evaluated against the WCAG guidelines
							for content to be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.</p>

						<p>For example, it is not sufficient to correctly order content within individual <a
								data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a> if the <a
								data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-spine">spine</a> ordering of documents is incorrect. Likewise,
							including a title for every EPUB content document is complementary to providing a title for
							the publication: the overall accessibility decreases if either is missing.</p>

						<p>The EPUB Accessibility Techniques [[?epub-a11y-tech-12]] provide more information about
							applying these guidelines to EPUB publications.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-wcag-application">
						<h5>Applying the conformance criteria</h5>

						<p>When evaluating an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>, the WCAG
								<a data-cite="wcag2#conformance-reqs">conformance criteria</a> [[wcag2]] are applied as
							follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>When determining compliance with a conformance level, the whole EPUB publication MUST
								meet the conformance requirements of the level claimed.</li>

							<li><a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> MUST NOT use EPUB's
								fallback mechanisms to provide a <a data-cite="wcag2#dfn-conforming-alternate-versions"
									>conforming alternate version</a> [[wcag2]], as there is no reliable way for users
								to access such fallbacks. If an EPUB publication uses fallbacks, both the primary
								content and its fallback(s) MUST meet the requirements for the conformance level
								claimed. EPUB-specific fallback mechanisms include <a
									data-cite="epub/#sec-manifest-fallbacks">manifest fallbacks</a> [[epub]], <a
									data-cite="epub/#sec-opf-bindings">bindings</a> [[epub]] and content switching via
								the <a data-cite="epub/#sec-xhtml-content-switch"><code>epub:switch</code> element</a>
								[[epub]].</li>

							<li>The "<a data-cite="wcag2#cc2">Full Pages</a>" requirement [WCAG2] -- that parts of a

						<h5>Overview</h5>

						<p>Statically paginated content is still ubiquitous, as print continues to be the most consumed
							medium for books both among the general reading public and in educational settings. Print is
							not the only source of static pagination, either: static page boundaries are also present in
							fixed-layout digital publications.</p>

						<p>As a result, non-visual readers face disadvantages relative to their peers in environments
							that use statically paginated content as they cannot easily locate the same locations in a
							publication (e.g., if a teacher instructs students to all turn to a specific page).</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page boundary locations helps bridge this disparity by ensuring the choice
							of reflowable media does not disadvantage those users.</p>

						<p>Providing page navigation also helps in reflowable publications that do not have a statically
							paginated equivalent. The default pagination of these publications by <a
								data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> is not static since it
							changes depending on the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-viewport">viewport</a> size and user's font
							settings. As a result, coordinating locations among users of the same <a
								data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> can be complicated without
							static references.</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page navigation represents one method of achieving the <a
								data-cite="wcag2#multiple-ways">Multiple Ways success criterion</a> [[wcag2]], as it
							provides another meaningful way for users to access the content (e.g., in addition to the
							table of contents, linear reading order and any other navigation aids).</p>

						<p>Given the importance of page navigation in mixed print/digital environments, the requirement
							to include this feature has higher precedence than it would solely as one of many ways to
							meet the Multiple Ways success criterion.</p>

					<h4>Synchronized text-audio playback</h4>

					<section id="sec-sync-overview" class="informative">
						<h5>Overview</h5>

						<p>The provision of synchronized text-audio playback helps address various user needs. It not
							only enables a seamless visual and auditory reading experience from beginning to end of an
								<a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>, but is useful to users
							who only require audio playback (e.g., who cannot see the text or are prevented from reading
							visually due to motion-sickness) or who only benefit from reading with text highlighting
							(e.g., readers with dyslexia).</p>

						<p>Unlike purely linear listening experiences, EPUB with synchronized text-audio playback
							preserves the user's ability to navigate around the publication, such as via the table of
							contents, and also introduces audio-centric reading features like phrase navigation, and
							ways to control which parts of the content are read aloud.</p>

						<p>In order to offer users greater control over content presentation, EPUB publications need to
							include structure and semantics so that the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system"
								>reading system</a> has the necessary context to enable this type of user experience.
							With greater context, a reading system can provide the ability to skip past secondary
							content that interferes with the primary narrative and escape users from deeply nested
							structures like tables.</p>

						<p>Adding structure and semantics to synchronized text-audio playback broadly falls under the
							objective of the <a data-cite="wcag2#info-and-relationships">Info and Relationships success
								criterion</a> [[wcag2]]. Without structured and semantically meaningful playback
							sequences, the effect is to deprive users of rich navigation of the content.</p>

									<p>Although it is possible for users who require a publication in audio form to use

									<p>Every <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> has a
										default reading order that allows users to progress through the content. The
										default reading order consists of two parts: the order of references in the

											data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a> that
										make up the publication, while the markup within each EPUB content document
										provides the default progression through the content elements (i.e., as
										represented in the document object model [[dom]]).</p>
									<p>For many languages, the default reading order also matches the logical reading
										order &#8212; the way that users will naturally follow the narrative. It ensures
										that readers can follow the primary narrative and that they encounter secondary
										content where the author intended it to be read. The default reading order also
										establishes some less obvious relations, like the progress within a table from
										cell to cell and row to row.</p>
									<p>If the sequence of the synchronized text-audio playback does not match this
										progression, it can cause confusion for readers, whether they are only listening
										to the audio or trying to also follow visually.</p>
									<p>Ordering the playback to match the default reading order is the safest way to
										ensure that users can follow the text. In some cases, however, strict adherence
										to this practice can result in a suboptimal reading experience (e.g., playback
										of a table by column instead of row might make more natural sense in some
										cases). These publications have a logical reading order that cannot match the
										default order of the elements of the host format.</p>

					<h4>Re-evaluating conformance</h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The following guidance is provided only to help determine when a new evaluation is necessary.
							It is not a conformance requirement of this specification.</p>
					</div>

					<p>How long a conformance evaluation of an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publication</a> is good for is a complex question. Unlike web sites, which are continuously
						evolving, EPUB publications may not be updated again after their initial publication. As a
						result, an unmodified EPUB publication will always conform to its last evaluation.</p>

					<p>It is common in publishing, however, to release updated versions of an EPUB publication to fix
						errors and typos in the work, as well as to periodically release new editions. As not all
						changes to an EPUB publication substantively change its accessibility, this complicates the
						question of when to perform a new evaluation, as well as whether a full or partial re-evaluation
						will suffice.</p>

					<p>As a general rule, re-evaluate content whenever substantive changes are made to the structure and
						functionality of an EPUB publication, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>modifications to the nature or order of markup in <a
								data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>;</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to images that convey information;</li>
						<li>modifications to formatting that affects the readability (e.g., contrast); and</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to interactive controls, forms, etc.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If the EPUB publication includes substantively the same markup and content as the previous
						release, only the new modifications will likely need evaluation to re-confirm conformance.</p>

					<p>If an updated version of this specification or [[wcag2]] has been published since the last
						release of the EPUB publication, a new evaluation is recommended to ensure conformance to the
						latest standards. A full re-evaluation may not be necessary even in this case (e.g., only new or
						modified success criteria may need checking unless the standards undergo major changes to
						methodology or conformance).</p>

					<p>Conversely, an EPUB publication does not need a re-evaluation when only non-substantive changes
						are made to it, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>fixes for typographic errors in the text (i.e., no markup is changed);</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to decorative images;</li>
						<li>modifications to the formatting that do not affect the understanding of the content or
							change the text display; and</li>
						<li>modifications to <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a>
							metadata.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Individuals qualified to assess the accessibility of EPUB publications should make the
						determination of whether changes are substantive or not. An editor, for example, may not realize
						the impact of seemingly minor formatting changes.</p>

					<p>Even in the case of non-substantive changes, this specification recommends an updated evaluation
						(full or partial) if the accessibility standards have changed.</p>

					<p>Even more progressive approaches than those described here should also be considered. Waiting for
						content changes before reviewing and updating the accessibility of EPUB publications can leave
						them lacking recent improvements. For example, a publisher might prioritize periodic reviews of
						their top-selling EPUB publications to ensure they remain maximally usable to the widest
						possible audience.</p>

			<section id="sec-feedback">
				<h3>Feedback</h3>

				<p>While it is expected that publications will be assessed prior to certifying them accessible, due to
					the sheer volumes of content produced and the complexity of checking all the markup it is sometimes
					the case that issues will slip through to the final product. Accessibility reporting can also not be
					detailed enough for every user to be able to determine the suitability of the content for their
					needs.</p>

				<p>To assist users in reporting any accessibility issues they encounter, or to discover more about the

					using the <a href="#contactEmail"><code>a11y:contactEmail</code> property</a>.</p>

			<h2>Optimized publications</h2>

			<p>Although WCAG [[wcag2]] provides a general set of guidelines for making content broadly accessible,
				conformant content is not always optimal for specific user groups. Conversely, content optimized for a
				specific need or reading modality is often not conformant to WCAG exactly because it targets a specific
				audience.</p>

			<p>For example, an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> with synchronized text and
				audio can contain a full audio recording of the content but limit the text content to only the major
				headings. In this case, the EPUB publication is consumable by users who needs to hear the content (i.e.,
				they can listen to the full publication and can navigate between headings), but it is not usable by
				anyone who cannot hear the audio.</p>

			<p>In other words, when optimizing an EPUB publication for a specific reading modality, the failure to
				achieve a WCAG conformance level does not make the publication any less accessible to the intended
				audience.</p>

			<p>Defining requirements for optimized publications is outside the scope of this specification, as is
				formally recognizing other standards and guidelines that address these specific needs. The general model
				of this specification can be used as a basis for identifying how an EPUB publication has been optimized,
				however.</p>

			<p>In particular, if an EPUB publication meets the requirements of an optimization standard, the following
				best practices are recommended:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The EPUB publication should meet the <a href="#sec-discovery">discovery metadata requirements</a> of
					this specification so its accessible properties are machine-readable.</li>
				<li>The EPUB publication should identify the standard or guidelines it follows in a
						<code>conformsTo</code> property in accordance with [[dcterms]] so this information can be made
					available to users.</li>
				<li>If the standard does not define conformance values for use in the <code>conformsTo</code> property,
					the <code>conformsTo</code> property should include a URL [[url]] to where the standard is publicly
					available so users can look up the specific details of the optimization.</li>
				<li>If the identifier is not sufficient for a user to understand conformance (e.g., the guidelines are
					not publicly available), the metadata should provide additional information about the content has
					been optimized in the <a href="#confreq-schema-accessibilitySummary">accessibility summary</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>When creating guidelines for optimized EPUB publications, it is recommended that these practices be
				integrated as a formal requirement for conformance.</p>

			<div class="note">

			<h2>Distribution</h2>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Although <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> do not have to meet the
					recommendations in this section to conform to this specification, some jurisdictions require EPUB
					publications to follow similar practices. <a
						href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">Directive
						2019/882</a>, for example, includes similar requirements for digital publications distributed in
					the European Union.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The creation of accessible <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> does not
				guarantee that the publication will be obtainable or consumable by users in an accessible fashion.
				Depending on how they are distributed, other factors will influence their overall accessibility. For
				example, an accessible interface for locating and obtaining content is an essential part of the
				distribution process, as is the ability to search and review accessibility metadata.</p>

			<p>While many aspects of the distribution process are outside the scope of this specification, there are
				factors that can be controlled. For example, while a publisher typically does not control the
				accessibility of the digital rights management (DRM) scheme applied to their EPUB publications, they do
				control what usage rights to apply to their EPUB publications. So even though a DRM scheme may allow a
				publisher to block access to the text of the publication, that publisher needs to take care not to apply
				such a restriction as it could block the ability for <a>assistive technologies</a> to read the text
				aloud.</p>

			<p>To minimize the effects of distribution on accessibility, this specification advises adherence to the
				following distribution practices:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>do not impose restrictions that impair access by assistive technologies; and</li>
				<li>include accessibility metadata in the record format required for distribution of an EPUB publication
					(e.g., [[onix]] or [[marc21]]) when the format supports such metadata.</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="note">
				<p>The guidance in this section does not restrict EPUB publications from being distributed through
					inaccessible distribution channels. For example, where the distributor applies DRM that impairs
					access to the content.</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section id="privacy">
			<h2>Privacy and security</h2>

			<p>The authoring of accessible content does not introduce any new privacy or security considerations for
				users. Meeting accessibility requirements is about optimally using the available technologies, and no
				new features are introduced by this specification.</p>

			<p>The inclusion of accessibility metadata similarly does not introduce security or privacy issues, as
				describing an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> only provides a general
				idea of its suitability for different user groups.</p>

			<p>The use of accessibility metadata in <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a>,
				bookstores and any other interface that can build a profile of the user, on the other hand, has the
				potential to violate the user's privacy. While it might seem helpful to store and anticipate the type of
				content a user is most likely to consume, for example, or how best to initiate its playback, developers
				should not engage in such profiling unless explicit permission is obtained from the user and a means of
				easily removing the profile is available.</p>

			<p>Even in the case where a user assents to the application maintaining information about their
				accessibility needs, developers SHOULD ensure that this information is kept private (e.g., not share the
				information with third party advertisers or even with the original publisher).</p>

			<p>Developers SHOULD NOT store or mine information about the types of searches a user performs when
				searching for content based on its accessibility characteristics. This information can be used to
				indirectly profile the abilities of users.</p>
