    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>
        The Publishing Maintenance Working Group would like to make a special acknowledgment to notable
        contributors, and friends, we have lost along the way. In particular, EPUB, not just EPUB 3, would not be what is
        today without the vision, knowledge, and preternatural good nature of Garth Conboy. Similarly, Ben Schroeter
        will always be remembered for his tireless work to help EPUB reach its potential as a universally accessible
        format. We are forever in their debt.
