    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>Specifications, like art, are human creations. No human has done more for EPUB than Garth Conboy, who has
		been there every step of the way, from the very first OEB 1.0 in 1999 to EPUB 3.3 which also led to today's EPUB 3.4. None of this
		would have happened without Garth's vision, knowledge, and preternatural good nature. We dedicate EPUB 3.4 to his memory. 
        We are forever in your debt, Garth.</p>

    <p>The following members of the Publishing Maintenance Working Group contributed to the development of this specification:</p>
