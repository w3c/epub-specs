			<p>EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB

				web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
				container.</p>

				in EPUB 3 publications. It is not intended as a technical introduction to the format or to building
				reading systems.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="reading-overview">
				<h3>Reading this document</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3 format offers publishers the ability to create advanced reading experiences by leveraging
					the features and functionalities of the Open Web Platform. The ability to use HTML, SVG, CSS, and
					JavaScript enables not only rich and interactive reading experiences but allows content to be
					produced for languages regardless of their default horizontal or vertical writing directions. The
					choice of these technologies also allows [=EPUB publications=] to be accessibly produced for a wide
					range of user needs.</p>

				<p>This overview explores, at a high level, the authoring features of EPUB 3 that provide this
					functionality. This document is not intended as a tutorial on creating EPUB publications and does
					not delve into the technical details of the format or how reading systems operate. Rather, it is
					intended for a more general audience seeking to understand the benefits of creating their digital
					publications using the EPUB 3 format without having to read through technical specifications.</p>

				<p>Before jumping straight into the features, however, it is helpful to have a basic conceptual
					understanding of how an EPUB publication is constructed. An EPUB file is effectively just a ZIP file
					with some identifying metadata that allows reading systems to recognize and render the publication
					inside (the ZIP file is formally called the [=EPUB container=] in the specifications).</p>

				<p>One of the key files in this rendering process is called the [=package document=]. It provides the
					metadata about the publication, lists all of the resources, and specifies the order in which to
					present the [=EPUB content documents=] (i.e., the XHTML and SVG documents that, when rendered,
					provide the content).</p>

				<p>The other key file is the [=EPUB navigation document=]. This document includes the table of contents
					for the publication, and it may also contain other navigation aids the publisher has defined (e.g., a page
					list or list of landmarks).</p>

				<p>The following figure visually represents the structure of an EPUB publication:</p>

				<figure id="fig-epub-structure">
					<figcaption> Structure of an EPUB publication. </figcaption>
					<img src="images/epub.svg" width="600" aria-details="fig-epub-structure-diagram"
						alt="Visual structure of the main constituents of an EPUB publication"
						style="background-color: transparent;" />
				</figure>

				<details id="fig-epub-structure-diagram" class="desc">
					<summary style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Image description</summary>
					<p>'EPUB (OCF) container' as the outer most component which encapsulates the 'EPUB Publication'
						containing two documents 'Package Document' and 'Navigation Document' along with a inner
						component labelled 'Publication Resources' which contains multiple 'Content document (XHTML,
						SVG)', and multiple 'Other resource (CSS, png, mp3, mov,…)'. </p>
				</details>

				<p>The body of this document explores these resources in greater detail with the goal of providing
					greater insight into the array of features they enable in EPUB 3 publications.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="reading-specs">
				<h3>Reading the specifications</h3>

				<p>For those interested in going beyond the general introduction presented in this document, the EPUB
					3.4 specification [[epub-34]] contains all the essential authoring information.</p>

				<!-- <p>Prior to the previous release of EPUB 3, namely EPUB 3.3, reading the EPUB 3 specifications could be challenging. The format was split
					across multiple documents, and each document interspersed authoring and [=reading system=]
					requirements. With the release of EPUB 3.3, however, there is now only one the document to read.</p> -->

				<p>In addition, accessibility requirements for [=EPUB publications=] are described in the EPUB
					Accessibility specification [[epub-a11y-12]]. One of the great advantages of a digital format like
					EPUB 3 is that it breaks down the accessibility barriers of static print content. When constructed
					with accessibility in mind, publications are usable by users with diverse needs.</p>

				<p>While reading the Reading Systems specification [[epub-rs-34]] can help understand how content gets
					rendered, the technical details of this process are not necessary for authoring content.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For a list of all the recommendation-track EPUB 3 specifications and non-normative notes, refer
						to <a href="#app-documents"></a>.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="version-num">
				<h3>Version numbering</h3>

				<p>An initial point of confusion for people new to EPUB is the difference between "EPUB 3" the format
					and the EPUB 3 specification numbering. The current version of EPUB 3 is defined in the EPUB 3.4
					specification [[epub-34]]. The minor number attached to the specification (".4") differentiates one
					release of the specification from the next, but each new release does not represent a new
					format.</p>

				<p>The W3C working group that maintains EPUB 3 strives not to invalidate content produced to earlier
					versions of the specification, so an EPUB 3 publication produced to the EPUB 3.0 specification, for
					example, should also be valid to the EPUB 3.4 requirements.</p>

				<p>That is also why this overview is for "EPUB 3", as it typically does not change significantly from
					one specification release to the next.</p>

				<p class="note"> At this moment, the [[[epub-34]]] [[epub-34]] version is in development; it is based on
					the stable [[[epub-33]]] [[epub-33]] version, but the Working Group is adding some new features. </p>

			<h2>The EPUB container</h2>

			<p>An [=EPUB publication=] is transported and interchanged as a single file (a "portable document") that
				contains the [=package document | package document=], the [=EPUB content documents=], and all other
				required resources for processing the publication. The single-file container format for EPUB is based on
				the widely adopted ZIP format, and an XML document that identifies the location of the package document
				for the publication in the ZIP archive is located at a pre-defined location within the archive.</p>

			<p>This approach provides a clear contract between any creator of an EPUB publication and any system which
				consumes such EPUB publications, as well as a reliable representation that is independent of network
				transport or file system specifics.</p>

			<p>It also ensures that EPUB publications may be created and are editable using widely available ZIP tools.
				Publishers have the flexibility to use either commercially available editing applications or build their
				own content transformation pipelines.</p>

			<p>For more information about an EPUB publication's representation as a container file, refer to the <a
					data-cite="epub-34#sec-ocf">Open Container Format (OCF)</a> section of [[epub-34]].</p>

		</section>
		<section id="sec-package-file">
			<h2>The package document</h2>

			<p>Every [=EPUB publication=] is represented by a [=package document=]. The package document specifies all
				the resources required to render that representation of the content. The package document also defines a
				reading order for linear consumption (called a [=spine=]), and associates metadata and navigation information.</p>

			<p>The package document defines a layer on top of the traditional structuring of a typical web site. This layer includes a list of resources and indicates reading order. A web site, for example, embeds references to its
				resources within its content, which, while a simple and flexible means of identifying resources, makes
				it difficult to enumerate all the resources required to render it. In addition, there is no standard way
				for a web site to define that a sequence of pages make up a larger publication, which is precisely what
				EPUB's [^spine^] element [[epub-34]] does (i.e., it provides an external declarative means to explicitly
				specify navigation through a collection of documents).</p>

			<p data-cite="epub-34">The package document also provides a standard way to represent metadata globally
				applicable to the content. Each package document includes a <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-pkg-metadata"
					>metadata section</a> [[epub-34]] for general information about the EPUB publication, allowing
				titles, authors, identifiers, and other information to be easily accessed and presented to users. It
				also provides the means to attach complete bibliographic records using the [^link^] element
				[[epub-34]].</p>

			<p>The package document also allows a [=unique identifier=] to be established for the EPUB publication using
				the <a data-cite="epub-34#attrdef-package-unique-identifier"><code>unique-identifier</code>
					attribute</a> [[epub-34]]. This identifier provides a way for publishers to differentiate one
				publication from another, and even one edition from another.</p>

			<p>For more information about the package document, refer to the <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-package-doc">Package
					document</a> section of [[epub-34]].</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-nav">
			<h2>Navigation</h2>

			<!-- <section id="sec-nav-order"> -->
				<!-- <h3>Reading order</h3> -->

				<p>A key concept of EPUB is that an [=EPUB publication=] consists of multiple resources that can be
					completely navigated and consumed by a person or program <em>in some specific order</em>.</p>

				<p>Many types of publication have an obvious reading order, or logical progression through their
					content. A novel is an example of a highly sequential document — it typically has a beginning,
					middle, and end — but not all publications are so ordered: a cookbook or a collection of
					photographic images is more like a database. All documents do, however, have at least one logical
					ordering of all their top-level content items, whether by date, topic, location, or some other
					criteria (e.g., a cookbook is typically arranged by recipe type).</p>

				<p>Each EPUB publication defines at least one such logical ordering of all its top-level content listed in the
					[=EPUB spine | spine=]. Each also defines a declarative table of contents in the <a
						href="#sec-nav-nav-doc">EPUB navigation document</a> [[epub-34]]. EPUB publications make these
					data structures available in a machine-readable way <em>external</em> to the content, simplifying
					their discovery and use.</p>

				<p>EPUB publications are not limited to the linear ordering of their contents, nor do they preclude
					linking in arbitrary ways — just like the web, EPUB publications are built on hypertext — but the
					basic consumption and navigation can be reliably accomplished in a way that is not true for a set of
					HTML pages.</p>
			<!-- </section> -->

			<section id="sec-nav-nav-doc">
				<h3>Navigation document</h3>

				<p>Each [=EPUB publication=] contains a special [=XHTML content document=] called the [=EPUB navigation
					document=]. This document uses the [[html]] [^nav^] element to define human- and machine-readable
					navigation information. All [=reading systems=] make use of the EPUB navigation document to present
					a table of contents to their users.</p>

				<p>The EPUB navigation document provides baseline accessibility and navigation support and offers
					features to enhance navigation for all users. Prime among these are support for internationalization
					(for example, as an XHTML document itself, the EPUB navigation document natively supports <a
						data-lt="ruby">ruby annotations</a>) and support for embedded formats (MathML and SVG can be
					included within navigation links).</p>

				<p>Although EPUB reading systems are not required to support these advanced text formatting features
					when they process the data to create their own table of contents, the dual role of the EPUB
					navigation document means the features can still be useful for their intended audience. Publishers
					can include the EPUB navigation document listed in the [=EPUB spine | spine=] [[epub-34]] (i.e., as a page
					of content in the publication) so that users have direct access to the full HTML.</p>

				<p>Including the EPUB navigation document in the body of an EPUB publication also allows publishers
					to tailor the display differently for users and reading systems. In highly structured documents, for
					example, it might not be desirable to display the complete table of contents to users in the body of
					the publication. In this case, the display level can be modified using the <a
						data-cite="epub-34#sec-nav-doc-use-spine"><code>hidden</code> attribute</a> [[epub-34]]. This
					attribute is ignored by reading systems when they render the table of contents outside the [=EPUB
					spine | spine=] (e.g., in their own specialized views), which avoids minimizing the information that
					is available and improves the overall accessibility.</p>

				<p>Publishers can also supply additional [^nav^] elements if their EPUB publications contain
					non-structural points of interest, such as to page breaks, landmarks, figures, tables, etc., to
					further enhance access to the content.</p>

				<p>For more information about the structure and semantics of EPUB navigation documents, refer to the <a
						data-cite="epub-34#sec-nav">EPUB navigation document</a> section of [[epub-34]].</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-content-docs">
			<h2>Content documents</h2>

			<p>Each [=EPUB publication=] contains one or more [=EPUB content documents=], as defined in [[epub-34]].
				These are HTML or SVG documents that describe the readable content and reference associated media
				resources (e.g., images, audio, and video clips).</p>

			<p>HTML documents for EPUB are formally defined as a <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-xhtml">profile of
				HTML</a> [[html]]. In particular, that profile requires the usage of the <a
					data-cite="html#writing-xhtml-documents">XML syntax</a> [[html]], referred to as [=XHTML content
				documents=] in the EPUB specifications.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>The term "XHTML" should not be confused with an earlier, fully XML based version of HTML denoted as
					"XHTML 1.1" [xhtml11]. XHTML 1.1 was originally published in 2001 and was officially retired by the
					W3C in 2018, whereas an [=XHTML content documents=] relies on the latest versions of [[html]]. This
                    means, for example, that an XHTML document in EPUB may contain
                    <span data-cite="html">[^audio^] or [^video^]</span> elements, which was not possible in "XHTML 1.1".
                     See also <a href="#epub30"></a> for further details.</p>
			</div>

			<section id="sec-rendering">
				<h2>Rendering and CSS</h2>

				<p>A key concept of EPUB is that content presentation adapts to the user, rather than the user having to
					adapt to a particular presentation of content. HTML was originally designed to support dynamic
					rendering of structured content, but over time HTML as supported in web browsers has become focused
					on the needs of web applications, and many popular web sites now have layouts with less
					flexibility.</p>

				<p>[=EPUB publications=], however, are designed to maximize accessibility for all users, and
					[=reading systems=] typically perform text line layout and pagination on the fly, adapting to the
					size of the display area, the user's preferred font size, and other environmental factors. This
					behavior is not guaranteed in EPUB; images, vector graphics, video, and other non-reflowable content
					might be included, and some reading systems might not paginate on the fly, or at all. Nevertheless,
					supporting dynamic adaptive layout and accessibility has been a primary design consideration
					throughout the evolution of the EPUB standard.</p>

				<p>EPUB content documents can reference CSS style sheets, allowing publishers to define the desired
					rendering properties and possibly sophisticated layouts. EPUB 3 follows support for CSS
                    as defined in the [[csssnapshot]].</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also supports CSS styles that enable both horizontal and vertical layout and both
					left-to-right and right-to-left writing.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-multimedia">
				<h2>Multimedia</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports the embedding of audio and video in [=XHTML content documents=] via the [[html]]
						<span data-cite="html">[^audio^] and [^video^]</span> elements, inheriting all the functionality
					and features these elements provide (e.g., built-in start, stop, and volume controls). For more
					information on the audio and video formats EPUB 3 supports, refer to the section on <a
						data-cite="epub-34#sec-core-media-types">core media types</a> [[epub-34]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-fonts">
				<h2>Fonts</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports two closely related font formats — OpenType [[opentype]] and WOFF [[woff]]
					[[woff2]] — to accommodate both traditional publishing workflows and emerging web-based workflows.
					Word processing programs used to create [=EPUB publications=] are likely to have access only to a
					collection of installed OpenType fonts, for example, whereas web-archival EPUB generators will
					likely only have access to WOFF resources (which cannot be converted to OpenType without
					undesirable, and potentially unlicensed, stripping of WOFF metadata).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-scripting">
				<h2>Scripting</h2>

				<p>EPUB strives to treat content <em>declaratively</em> — as data that can be manipulated, not as
					programs to be executed — but does support scripting as defined in [[html]] and [[svg]]. This allows
					publishers to build and add dynamic content such as quizzes, interactive games, and so forth.</p>

				<p>Scripting in an EPUB publication can create security considerations that are different from scripting
					within a web browser, however. For example, typical same-origin policies are not applicable to
					content that has been downloaded to a user's local system. For these reasons, scripting is best
					limited to cases where it is essential to the user experience, since it greatly increases the
					likelihood that content will not be portable across all reading systems and creates barriers to
					accessibility and content reusability.</p>

				<p>It is also important to note that EPUB 3 does not require scripting support in reading systems, and
					scripting might be disabled for security reasons. Publishers need to consider how their publications
					will remain readable by users before scripting content essential to its understanding.</p>

				<p>Refer to the section on <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-scripted-content">Scripting</a> [[epub-34]]
                    for more information on scripting capabilities.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-semantic-enrichment">
				<h3>Semantic enrichment</h3>

				<p>[=XHTML content documents=] also include the means of adding rich metadata to document markup,
					making them more semantically meaningful and useful both for processing and accessibility purposes.
					Publishers can use both RDFa [[rdfa-in-html]] and Microdata [[microdata]] attributes for this
					purpose, and also embed JSON-LD metadata records [[json-ld]] in the [[html]] [^script^] element.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-structural-semantics">
				<h3>Structural semantics</h3>

				<p>EPUB 3 also includes the [^/epub:type^] attribute [[epub-34]] for adding additional information to
					any element in an [=EPUB content document=] to express its purpose and meaning within the work.</p>

				<p>Although these semantics are primarily for use in publishers' internal workflows, they do provide
					enhanced [=reading system=] behaviors in some cases (specifically, for pop-up footnotes).</p>

				<p>Refer to the section on <a data-cite="epub-34#app-structural-semantics">Expressing structural
					semantics</a> [[epub-34]] for more information.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-layouts">
			<h2>Layouts</h2>

			<section id="sec-reflow">
				<h3>Reflowable layouts</h3>

				<p>At its core, EPUB is designed for dynamic layout: content is typically intended to be formatted on
					the fly rather than being typeset in a paginated manner in advance. This core capability is useful
					for optimizing rendering onto different-sized device screens or window sizes, and it facilitates and
					simplifies content accessibility.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also offers metadata allowing publishers to specify their preferred rendering of reflowable
					content. Supporting reading systems could offer users a scrolled view of a reflowable document, for
					example, instead of paginating it.</p>

				<p>For more information, refer to the section on <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-reflowable-layouts">Reflowable layouts</a>
					[[epub-34]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-fxl">
				<h3>Fixed layouts</h3>

				<p>Although EPUB's history is steeped in enabling reflowable content, not all publications lend
					themselves easily to reflowing. Page-precise layouts are required to meaningfully represent
					children's books, comics and manga, magazines, and many other content forms.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 includes metadata that allows the creation of <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-fixed-layouts"
						>fixed-layout XHTML content documents</a> [[epub-34]], in addition to existing capabilities for
					fixed layouts in SVG. This metadata enables the control of the <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-fxl-content-dimensions">page
                        dimensions</a> [[epub-34]], creating a
                    canvas on which elements can be absolutely positioned.</p>

                <p>Fixed layouts come in two flavors, namely:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li id="item-fxl-pp">
                        <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-pre-paginated">Pre-paginated layout</a>, where each fixed-layout document
                        in the spine represents one page of content. Reading systems are expected to
                        scale the document to fit the viewport or synthetic spread. Typical usage examples may be children's books,
                        comics, or cookbooks.
                    </li>
                    <li id="item-fxl-roll">
                        <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-roll">Roll layout</a>, where each fixed-layout document in the spine
                        is fit to the viewport by the reading system, and the contents are displayed in a continuous roll with no visible gaps.
                        Typical usage examples are webtoons.
                    </li>
                </ul>

				<p>For more information, refer to the section on <a data-cite="epub-34#sec-fixed-layouts">Fixed
					layouts</a> [[epub-34]]. See also the visual examples for a
                    <a data-cite="epub-34#spread-page-spread-right-figure">pre-paginated</a>
                    and a <a data-cite="epub-34#layout-roll-figure">roll</a> publication in the [[epub-34]] specification.</p>

                <p class="note">Roll layout is a new feature in EPUB 3.4. It will take some years before it becomes available by
                    major Reading Systems. Users should be aware of this limitation.

        <section id="sec-aural-rendering">
            <h2>Aural rendering</h2>
            <p>Although EPUB 3 is primarily considered a visual reading format, EPUB publications are designed to enable their aural
            rendering as well. There are two primary ways this can done:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>through the text-to-speech rendering of an EPUB publication's text content; and</li>
                <li>
                    through the provision of prerecorded audio whose playback is synchronized with the text, referred to as media overlays.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <section>
                <h3>Text-to-speech</h3>

                <p>Unfortunately, there are currently no broadly supported technologies for text-to-speech, which also means that the EPUB
                    specification cannot normatively refer any specific approach. Nevertheless, there exist a number of specifications
                    that may be used to "assist" text-to-speech, like SSML [[ssml]], pronunciation lexicons [[pronunciation-lexicon]],
                    or CSS speech [[css-speech]]. These are all valid for EPUB publications. However, with the lack of dominant
                    text-to-speech technologies the implementation of these specifications is often lacking in reading systems. With
                    the evolution of relevant techniques, new approaches may come to the fore in coming years, which can hopefully be

                <h3>Media overlays</h3>

                <p id="para-media-overlay">A key multimedia feature of EPUB 3 is the ability to define media overlays.
                    When pre-recorded narration is available for an [=EPUB publication=], media overlays provide the ability
                    to synchronize the playback of that audio with the text of an [=EPUB content document=]. Users can watch
                    as the text of the publication is highlighted while it is read back to them, or just listen to the
                    audio.</p>

                <p>Media overlays have benefits beyond the obvious accessibility one of allowing users who cannot see the
                    content to listen to it. They are used, for example, to synchronize text and audio as a tool for
                    learning to read.</p>

			<h2>Global language support</h2>

			<p>EPUB 3 leverages the features in XHTML, SVG, CSS, or MathML for global language support.
                Publishers may use the Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) [[its20]] to facilitate
                translations and multilingual publications. EPUB 3 also relies on [[unicode]] for encoding the content.
                This means that [=EPUB content documents=] can use different character sets
                and express bidirectional text, ruby annotations, or typography for many different languages and cultures.</p>

			<p>The following list describes some of the key additions for global language support that are specific to
				EPUB 3:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Alternate language metadata</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>EPUB 3 supports alternate representations of all text metadata items in the package metadata
						section to improve global distribution of [=EPUB publications=]. The <a
							data-cite="epub-34#alternate-script"><code>alternate-script</code> property</a> [[epub-34]]
						can be combined with the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute to include and identify alternate
						script renderings of language-specific metadata.</p>
					<p>Using this property, a Japanese EPUB publication could, for example, include an alternate
						Roman-script representation of the author's name and/or one or more representations of the title
						in a Romance language.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Base text direction</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Text metadata items may also rely on <a data-cite="epub-34#attrdef-dir">attributes specifying
							base direction</a> [[epub-34]] that allow for a finer control of bidirectional texts (e.g.,
						titles that combine Latin and Arabic or Hebrew characters). </p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Page progression direction</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The <code>page-progression-direction</code> attribute in the [=package document=] allows the
						content flow direction to be globally specified for all EPUB content documents to facilitate
						rendering (see the <a data-cite="epub-34#attrdef-spine-page-progression-direction"
							>page-progression-direction</a> attribute in [[epub-34]]).</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Fonts</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>EPUB 3 does not require that reading systems come with a set of built-in system fonts. As occurs
						in web contexts, users in a particular locale might have installed fonts that omit characters
						required for other locales and reading systems might utilize intrinsic fonts or font engines
						that do not utilize operating system installed fonts. As a result, the text content of an EPUB
						publication might not natively render as intended on all reading systems.</p>
					<p>EPUB 3's support for embedding fonts facilitates the rendering of text content by ensuring
						content is rendered as intended.</p>
					<p>Support for embedded fonts also ensures that publishers can embed characters and glyphs unique to
						an EPUB publication for proper display.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Container</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The OCF container format supports UTF-8, allowing for internationalized file and directory naming
						of content resources.</p>
				</dd>

			<h2>Accessibility</h2>

			<p>A major goal of EPUB is to facilitate content accessibility. A variety of features in EPUB 3 support
				this requirement. More specifically, the EPUB Accessibility specification [[epub-a11y-12]] provides a
				framework for evaluating the accessibility of [=EPUB publications=]. It leverages the extensive work
				done to define web content accessibility in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[wcag21]], an
				internationally recognized standard for content accessibility.</p>

			<p>The specification defines requirements to produce [=EPUB publications=] that can be accessed by a wide
				range of users. It is accompanied by a techniques document [[epub-a11y-tech-12]] that outlines best
				practices for meeting these requirements.</p>

			<p>It is important to note that while accessibility is important in its own right, accessible content is
				also more valuable content: an accessible EPUB publication will be adaptable to more devices and be
				easier to reuse, in whole or in part, via human and automated workflows.</p>

			<p>Some specific content features of EPUB 3 that enable the creation of highly accessible content
				include:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>HTML semantic markup</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>HTML incorporates a number of elements that make markup more semantically meaningful.
                        These include, for example, the [^section^], [^nav^], and [^aside^] elements.
                        These elements allow content to be better grouped and defined, both to represent the
                        structure of documents and to facilitate their logical navigation.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>HTML multimedia elements</dt>
				<dd>
					<p data-cite="html">The [^audio^] and [^video^] elements of HTML come with built-in controls that
						work with assistive technologies. These new elements allow users to control playback, no longer
						requiring plugins with poor accessibility support.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Reflowable layouts</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The default for EPUB publications is to reflow to fit the available screen space. This allows
						users to change the display to their liking (e.g., increasing font size, line and word spacing, or word
						spacing) without causing a publication to become unreadable — the resized content
						re-adapts itself to the available space.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>ARIA support</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>EPUB includes support for expressing ARIA [[wai-aria-1.2]] and DPUB-ARIA [[dpub-aria-1.1]] roles,
                        states, and properties both in XHTML and SVG content documents. These attributes allow publishers
                        to improve the accessibility of scripted controls and components.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>

        <section id="sec-annotation">
            <h2>Annotations</h2>

            <p>Most Reading Systems include the possibility to add annotations to their content.
                These are usually anchored to a specific position in a way that
                the anchor remains valid even if the content is repaginated or changed. The annotation itself is, traditionally, textual,
                although newer Reading Systems also allow the usage of images (usually created with an interactive pen).
            </p>

            <p>A major limitation of current systems is that these annotations are kept private. They cannot be exported and imported
                to another Reading System, let that be a different piece of software or hardware used by the same user, or exchanged with the
                user's peers. In other words, annotations cannot be <em>shared</em>.
            </p>

            <p>However, there are communities that need such annotation sharing. A teacher may want to annotate a pupil's work,
                members of a research team may want to share their notes on a document, etc. There are even cases when the annotations themselves
                gain a literary or scientific value on their own right, e.g., in religious or scientific literature.
            </p>

            <p>To overcome these restrictions, EPUB 3.4 defines an EPUB Annotation format [[epub-anno-10]] whose goals can be summarized as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Define a standard data model to structure and store annotations as a simple JSON data file. This JSON content can then be exported and/or imported by Reading Systems.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Specify a number of standard anchoring methods (referred to as "selectors") which provide a common base for importing and
                        re-attaching external annotations to the local content.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Technically, the EPUB Annotation model is defined as a restricted profile of an existing W3C standard called the [[[annotation-model]]] [[annotation-model]].
            </p>

            <p class="note">EPUB Annotation is a new feature in EPUB 3.4. It will take some years before it becomes available by
                major Reading Systems. Users should be aware of this limitation.
            </p>
        </section>

		<section id="sec-experimental">
			<h2>New and experimental features</h2>

			<p>EPUB 3 is continuously evolving with the web to adapt new features and technologies. The specification
				references a number of web standards that automatically becomes valid to use as soon as they change.
				HTML, for example, is now called a "living standard" because new features are added once there are at
				least two implementations. EPUB 3 also references versions of SVG [[svg]], JavaScript [[ecmascript]],
				and Unicode [[unicode]] that adapt to new releases, and the CSS reference is tied to the latest snapshot
				[[csssnapshot]].</p>

			<p>What this means for EPUB 3 is that as new features are added to these standards, they are also
				immediately valid to use in [=EPUB publications=]. (That does not mean it is always wise to use such
				features right away, as [=reading systems=] often take longer to implement support, and vendors may not
				always allow the new features past their validation routines.)</p>

			<p>The EPUB Working Group may also introduce new and experimental features from time-to-time outside of the
				core specifications. This is typically done because the features do not have sufficient real-world
				support in reading systems yet, or because the Working Group is looking for implementation feedback
				before trying to standardize the technology.</p>

			<p>There are currently two such experimental features: multiple-rendition publications
				[[epub-multi-rend-11]] and text-to-speech enhancements [[epub-tts-10]]. Publishers may use these
				features in their publications but should do so with the awareness that there may be limited
				support.</p>

            <p class="note">Experimental features are usually published in separate Working Group Notes, and are not
                part of the core specifications. See <a href="#sec-doc-notes">the list of notes</a> below.

			<h2>EPUB revision history</h2>

			<section id="epub2">
				<h3>OEB, OCF and EPUB 2: 1999—2010</h3>

				<p>EPUB has its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication Structure (OEBPS).
					OEBPS 1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an organization that later became the
					International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the
					IDPF in 2001 and 2002, respectively.</p>

				<p>It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for delivery as well as
					interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container format for OEPBS, which was
					approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS
					began in parallel which was renamed EPUB 2.0 in October 2007 and approved in September 2010. This
					revision consisted of a triumvirate of specifications: Open Package Format (OPF), Open Publication
					Structure (OPS), and OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, which was a maintenance update to the 2.0 specification set,
					primarily intended to clarify and correct errata in the specifications. See [[opf-201]] [[ops-201]]
					[[ocf-201]]. </p>

			</section>
			<section id="epub30">
				<h3>EPUB 3.0: 2010</h3>
				<p> Work on a major revision of the EPUB specifications began in 2010, with the goal of aligning EPUB
					more closely with HTML. As part of that alignment, the reference to HTML was changed: while EPUB 2.0
					referred to XHTML 1.1 [[xhtml11]], EPUB 3.0 relies on the XML serialization of HTML [[html]]
					(referred to as "HTML5" at the time). This resulted in bringing new, native multimedia features,
					sophisticated CSS layout rendering and font embedding, MathML support, scripted interactivity,
					vertical writing and other enhanced global language support, and improved accessibility. </p>

				<p> A new specification for EPUB Media Overlays was also introduced, allowing for text and audio
					synchronization in EPUB publications. To better align the specification names with the standard, the
					Open Package Format specification was renamed EPUB publications, and the Open Publication Format
					specification was renamed EPUB Content Documents. The EPUB 3.0 specifications were approved in
					October 2011. See [[epubpublications-30]] [[epubcontentdocs-30]] [[ocf-30]] [[epubmediaoverlays-30]]
					[[epubchanges-30]]. </p>
			</section>

			<section id="epub301">
				<h3>EPUB 3.0.1: 2014</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3.0.1 revision was undertaken in 2013-14. Although introducing mostly minor fixes and
					updates, it did see the integration of fixed layout documents to provide greater control over the
					presentation of EPUB publications. See [[epubpublications-301]] [[epubcontentdocs-301]] [[ocf-301]]
					[[epubmediaoverlays-301]] [[epubchanges-301]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="epub31">
				<h3>EPUB 3.1: 2017</h3>

				<p>EPUB 3.1 was the first minor revision of EPUB 3. The goal of that revision was to better align EPUB 3
					with web standards of the time. References to important standards were made undated, meaning that
					whenever they are updated they are legal to use in EPUB 3 content (e.g., the latest version of HTML
					is always valid to use; a revision of EPUB is not needed). The use of CSS was also clarified, and
					the use of EPUB-specific properties reduced.</p>

				<p>Many EPUB-specific features were also removed from the standard, in particular content switching,
					triggers, and bindings. This change necessitated a new package document version number.

				<h3>EPUB 3.2: 2018</h3>

				<p>The work on EPUB 3.2 was undertaken shortly after EPUB 3.1 to restore compatibility of content to
					EPUB 3. The change of version number introduced in EPUB 3.1 meant that publishers, vendors and
					reading system developers would have had to produce, distribute, and consume two versions of EPUB
					content, but the costs of this change outweighed the benefits of the new version. EPUB 3.2 instead
					kept all the best parts of EPUB 3.1 but deprecated elements instead of removing them so that a new
					version number was not necessary in the package document. See [[epub-32]] [[epubpackages-32]]
					[[epubcontentdocs-32]] [[ocf-32]] [[epubmediaoverlays-32]] [[epubchanges-32]]</p>
			</section>

			<section id="epub33">
				<h3>EPUB 3.3: 2022</h3>

				<p>The work on EPUB 3.3 [[epub-33]] was undertaken in 2020-21, and was the first version of the EPUB 3
					series published as a W3C Recommendation. EPUB 3.3 did not include any significant technical change
					to, and is strongly backward compatible with, EPUB 3.2. This means that any valid EPUB 3.2
					Publication is also a valid EPUB 3.3 Publication. </p>

				<p>The documents themselves have been restructured. The primary motivation for this restructuring, as
					well as an extensive editorial revision, was to make the documents more readable. Also, as part of
					the thorough testing regime developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/"
						>W3C EPUB 3 Working Group</a>, this restructuring led to the separation of Recommendations and
					Working Group Notes (see also <a href="#app-documents">the detailed list of documents</a>). Features
					specified in the Recommendations were thoroughly tested, were widely implemented in reading systems,
					and they can be considered as interoperable. On the other hand, features specified in Working Group
					Notes, although they may have some authoring uptakes, still lacked support in reading systems; as a
					result, these technologies should not yet be considered stable and interoperable.</p>

				<p>The separate <a data-cite="epub-33#change-log">section</a> in [[epub-33]] provides a more detailed
					overview of the changes.</p>

				<p>The W3C Recommendation was published in 2023, with a minor update in 2025.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="epub34">
				<h3>EPUB 3.4: 2027</h3>

                <p>Part of the work on EPUB 3.4, which started in 2025, was simplification: a number of attributes, primarily
                    related to layout, were removed from the specification. These attributes were usually ignored
                    by Reading Systems, due to the way these systems interact with the users. A good example was the
                    choice between landscape and portrait view of the content: in EPUB 3.3 the publisher
                    had the possibility to choose between these two. However, Reading Systems usually preferred to leave
                    this choice to the end user, and the attribute was ignored.
                </p>

                <p>EPUB 3.4 has also added some new features to EPUB 3. The most notable are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The introduction of <a href="#item-fxl-roll">roll layout</a>, making it possible to include
                        "webtoons" into EPUB Publications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#sec-annotation">Exchanging annotations</a> among Reading Systems, particularly useful
                        in, for example, scholarly publications or higher education.
                </li>
                </ul>
