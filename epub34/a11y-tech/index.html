			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>This document, EPUB Accessibility Techniques, provides informative guidance on how to understand and
					apply the accessibility requirements defined in the EPUB Accessibility 1.2 specification
					[[epub-a11y-12]] that are unique to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
						publications</a>.</p>

				<p>This document does not cover general web accessibility techniques already addressed in [[wcag2]] and
					[[wai-aria]], for example, for which no substantive differences in application exist. Following
					those techniques, as applicable, is also essential to meeting the accessibility requirements of the
					EPUB Accessibility 1.2 specification.</p>

				<p>This document is not intended to be read in isolation, in other words, as it does not define
					conformance requirements for making accessibility claims or cover every method for producing
					accessible content. An EPUB publication must meet all the requirements of EPUB Accessibility 1.2 to
					make a claim of accessibility; verifying only the techniques in this document is not sufficient.</p>

				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This document uses terminology defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-terminology">EPUB
						3.3</a> [[epub-3]] and <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#sec-terminology">EPUB Accessibility 1.2</a>

			<h2>About the techniques</h2>

			<p>The accessibility techniques described in this document are advisory in nature. They are intended to help
				create <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> that conform to
				the requirements in [[epub-a11y-12]], but they are not all applicable in all situations and there may be
				other ways to meet the requirements of that specification. As a result, this document should not be read
				as providing prescriptive requirements.</p>

			<p>These techniques also do not address issues in digital publishing for which no universally accessible
				solutions exist. The W3C's Digital Publishing Interest Group has published a note that outlines many of
				these issues [[dpub-accessibility]]. As solutions become available, they will be incorporated into the
				appropriate document, whether this one or one it refers to.</p>

			<p>When encountering issues that are not covered in these or related techniques, please report an issue to
				the appropriate community for guidance on how to meet accessibility standards. The <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/">W3C Web Accessibility Interest Group</a> has a public mailing list
				where issues meeting [[wcag2]] and [[wai-aria]] requirements can be raised. The <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/issues">W3C Publishing Community Group issue tracker</a> can
				be used to ask for support implementing EPUB-specific requirements and the <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues">EPUB 3 Working Group's issue tracker</a> to report
				issues with this document.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Accessibility metadata techniques are no longer covered by this guide. For information on how to
					apply accessibility metadata, please refer to the <a

			<h2>WCAG techniques</h2>

			<section id="sec-wcag-general">
				<h3>General guidance</h3>

				<p>Techniques for meeting the requirements of the [[wcag2]] are defined in <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/">Techniques for WCAG</a>. This document does not
					repeat those techniques.</p>

				<p>In general, the differences between the application of WCAG techniques to web pages and their
					application to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
						documents</a> is minimal, but the following sections outline some key differences.</p>

				<p>One point to note is that the WCAG techniques cover a greater range of technologies and content types
					than are typically found in an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
						publication</a>, so many are not applicable.</p>

				<p>The following sets of techniques are the most applicable to EPUB content documents:</p>

				</ul>

				<p>Other techniques could apply depending on the content of the EPUB publication (e.g., the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/#pdf">PDF Tecnhiques</a> would apply if there are
					embedded PDF forms).</p>

				<section id="sec-wcag-general-res">
					<h4>Helpful resources</h4>

					<p>Anyone unfamiliar with [[wcag2]] may find the number of techniques daunting, as they are intended
						to provide broad coverage of possible solutions.</p>

					<p>Assistance applying these techniques to EPUB content documents is available from the following
						sources:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p><a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/">DAISY Accessible Publishing Knowledge
									Base</a> — compendium of best practices by content type, with links to the
								applicable WCAG techniques.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><a href="https://www.bisg.org/products/bisg-guide-to-accessible-publishing--cheat-sheets"
									>BISG Guide to Accessible Publishing &amp; Cheat Sheets</a> — includes a set of top
								practices for making content accessible.</p>

			<section id="sec-wcag-content-access">
				<h3>Content access</h3>

				<section id="spread-order">
					<span id="access-001"></span>
					<h4>Ensure meaningful order of content across spreads</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#meaningful-sequence">Success Criterion 1.3.2</a> [[wcag2]] specifies that
						each web page have a meaningful order (i.e., that the visual presentation of the content match
						the underlying markup).</p>

					<p>As EPUB allows two <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
							documents</a> to be rendered together in a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#spread"
							>synthetic spread</a> [[epub-3]], the order of content within a single document cannot
						always be evaluated in isolation. Content may span visually from one document to the next. For
						example, a sidebar might span the bottom of two pages.</p>

					<p>Ordering each document separately by the visual display will lead to users of <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> encountering
						gaps between the start and end of the spanned text. If the markup cannot be arranged to provide
						a more logical reading experience (e.g., the beginning of the spanned content at the end of the
						first page followed by the conclusion at the start of the next), another means of satisfying
						this criteria will be necessary to avoid failure (e.g., a hyperlink could be provided to allow a
						user to jump from the break point on the first page to the continuation on the next).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="multiple-ways">
					<span id="access-002"></span>
					<h4>Provide multiple ways to access the content</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#multiple-ways">Success Criterion 2.4.5</a> [[wcag2]] requires there be more
						than one way to locate a web page within a set of web pages. By default, <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> meet this WCAG
						requirement so long as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-spine-elem">all EPUB content
							documents are included in the spine</a> and <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-itemref-elem">access to all non-linear documents is
							provided</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

					<p>The reason an EPUB publication passes by meeting these requirements has to do with differences in
						how a user interacts with the set of documents in an EPUB publication. In particular, although
						an EPUB publication typically consists of many <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>, <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> automatically
						provide the ability for the user to move seamlessly from one document to the next, so long as
						they are listed in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-spine-elem"
						>spine</a> [[epub-3]]. To the user, an EPUB publication is a single document they have complete
						access to, not a set of disconnected pages that they need links to move through.</p>

					<p>The required table of contents provides a second method to access the major headings of the
						publication. The user can jump to any heading and continue to navigate from there, regardless of
						how the publication is chunked.</p>

					<p>Following these two requirements therefore satisfies the need for multiple ways to access the
						content. Reading systems also typically provide search capabilities so users also have a third
						option available in most cases.</p>

					<p>Although following EPUB's basic requirements will meet this criterion, providing additional
						methods to improve access beyond the minimum is encouraged. Some suggestions include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>adding at least one link to every EPUB content document in the spine to the table of
								contents, when feasible;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>adding an index to locate major topics; and</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>adding additional navigation aids to the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation
									document</a> (e.g., lists of figures and tables).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<section id="sec-access-002-toc">
						<h5>Note about the table of contents</h5>

						<p>A common question about the EPUB table of contents is what completeness it needs to have with
							respect to the headings of the publication. Although the obvious answer seems like it should
							be a simple aggregation of all headings for all sections, practically there are several
							usability challenges to this approach.</p>

						<p>Factors such as device screen sizes can make the table of contents for publications with a
							deep hierarchy of headings unreadable, so headings below a certain depth get trimmed to
							improve the readability. Further, <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> do not
							always provide structured access to the headings in the table of contents, or provide
							shortcuts to navigate the links. The result is that users have to listen to each link one at
							a time to find where they want to go, a tedious and time-consuming process.</p>

						<p>Although it is expected that reading systems will improve access to the table of contents as
							accessibility support for EPUB evolves — making complete tables of contents usable by
							everyone — there are legitimate usability reasons why they are not provided now.</p>

						<p>When opting not to provide links to all the headings, it is best to optimize the links that
							are provided to improve the overall reading experience. Some considerations on how to
							achieve this include:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>ensuring that there is at least one link to every <a
										href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
										document</a> — allowing the user to reach each document simplifies navigation to
									the minor headings within them; and</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>only omitting minor headings from the table of contents — although a subjective
									decision, there is often a level of diminishing value for navigation (e.g., fourth
									level and lower headings often only delimit short subsections on a topic).</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section id="toc-linear-order">
					<span id="access-003"></span>
					<h4>Ensure the order of table of contents entries matches linear order</h4>

					<p>The table of contents provides users more than just links into the content. It is also a means to
						understand the structure and ordering of an <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>. Consequently,
						users may have difficulty locating where they are in a publication, where they want to go, and
						also how to return to previous locations when the order of entries in the table of contents does
						not match the linear reading order.</p>

					<p>To ensure that the table of contents matches the linear order of the content, the order of its
						entries should reflect both:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the order of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
								documents</a> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-spine">spine</a>;
							and</li>
						<li>the order of each referenced section within its respective EPUB content document.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Only if there is a logical case for an alternative arrangement of entries should the ordering
						differ. Such scenarios typically only occur when the content does not have to be read linearly
						or when additional information is included at the end of a table of contents. For example, the
						table of contents for a magazine might be ordered to list all the major articles first, followed
						by features, etc.</p>

					<p>When the ordering of the table of contents does not match the content, the <a
							href="#accessibilitySummary">accessibility summary</a> should explain why.</p>

					<p>Avoid linking directly to supplementary content from of the table of contents. Instead, define
						navigation lists to group together related links, such as a table of figures or a table of
						illustrations. These types of lists can be created using <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-def-types-other">custom <code>nav</code>
							elements</a> [[epub-3]] in the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation document</a>
						or using navigation lists in XHTML content documents. When these navigation lists are included
						in the <code>spine</code>, the table of contents can link users to them.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Reading systems do not always provide users an interface to access to custom <code>nav</code>
							elements in the EPUB navigation document. Consequently, when using the navigation document
							to add supplementary content lists, it is best to ensure the document is also included in
							the spine.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="access-bypass-blocks">
					<h4>Bypass blocks not necessary</h4>

					<p>Web sites are constructed very differently from EPUB publications. A typical web site wraps the
						content of each page within a repeating template, for example. This template gives each page a
						consistent look and feel, but users are rarely interested in the wrapper content after visiting
						the first page. Visual readers can typically skip past the site header, navigation bars, search
						boxes, and other helpful but seldom-used features to get right to the content.</p>

					<p>To provide the same ease of access to readers who would have to navigate sequentially through the
						repetitive content, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#bypass-blocks">success criterion
							2.4.1</a> [[wcag2]] requires a means of bypassing the repeated content in a set of pages.
						This success criterion does not apply to typical EPUB publications, however, as EPUB content
						documents do not repeat content in the same way that web sites do.</p>

					<p>Each new content document may begin with similar content, such as learning objectives or key
						terms, but this content is part of the body of the publication and not identical to what came
						before. Consequently, it is not required to add a link to skip it. (Secondary content should be
						identified in accordance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#info-and-relationships"
							>success criterion 1.3.1</a>, however.)</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>If an EPUB publication were to reproduce a set of web pages with their full site trappings,
							then success criterion 2.4.1 would apply, but this practice is not common.</p>
					</div>

			<section id="sec-wcag-roles">
				<h3>Roles</h3>

				<section id="roles-epub-type">
					<span id="sem-001"></span>
					<h4>ARIA roles and <code>epub:type</code></h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The following guidance is only for <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>.
							The <code>type</code> attribute is the only means of adding structural information to <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">media overlay
								documents</a> so that features like lists and tables can be navigated more efficiently.
							It is also required in the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation
								document</a> to identify key structures.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Although the <code>role</code> attribute may seem similar in nature to the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"
						><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[epub-3]], their target uses in EPUB content documents do not
						overlap.</p>

					<p>The key difference between these attributes is that the <code>role</code> attribute bridges
						accessibility in content while the <code>type</code> attribute provides hooks to enable <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> behaviors.
						Omitting roles lessens the accessibility for users of <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a>, in other
						words, while omitting types diminishes certain functionality in <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> (e.g., pop-up
						footnotes or special presentations of the content).</p>

					<p>Since each attribute offers different advantages, it is only necessary to pair them together when
						both attributes provide benefits. For example, it is common to pair footnote roles and types to
						ensure reading systems can provide pop-up functionality and assistive technologies can announce
						the type of link the user has encountered.</p>

					<p>For anyone looking to move from the <code>type</code> attribute to using ARIA roles, the <a
							href="https://idpf.github.io/epub-guides/epub-aria-authoring/">EPUB Type to ARIA Role
							Authoring Guide</a> details notable authoring differences between the two attributes. It
						also includes a mapping table of semantics in the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary to
						equivalent ARIA roles in [[dpub-aria-1.1]] and [[wai-aria]]. [[html-aria]] is another useful
						reference that provides the full list of restrictions on where ARIA roles can be used in
						HTML.</p>

					<p>Finally, be aware that the use of the <code>type</code> attribute is not a means of satisfying
						requirements for ARIA roles in WCAG.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="role-repetition">
					<span id="sem-002"></span>
					<h4>Do not repeat roles across chunked content</h4>

					<p>Although <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> appear
						as single contiguous documents to users when read, they are typically composed of many
						individual <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
							documents</a>. This practice keeps the amount of markup that has to be rendered small to
						reduce the load time in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
							systems</a> (i.e., to minimize the time the user has to wait for a document to appear). It
						is rare, at least for books, for an EPUB publication to contain only one EPUB content document
						with all the content in it.</p>

					<p>When content is chunked in this way, it often requires restructuring the information to fit
						within the new file structure. A part, for example, will typically not include all the chapters
						that belong to it. Instead, the part heading might be separated from each chapter, leaving each
						chapter in a separate document.</p>

					<p>Although visually these restructuring decisions can be hidden from readers, they impact the
						functionality of <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive
						technologies</a>. In the case of [[wai-aria]] roles, the result is that only the subset present
						in the currently-loaded EPUB content document are exposed to users. An assistive technology
						cannot provide a list of landmarks for the whole publication, as it cannot see outside the
						current document.</p>

					<p>To counteract this destructuring effect, a common bad practice is to re-add or re-identify
						structures in the belief that having this information in every document will be helpful to users
						(e.g., adding an extra [[html]] <a data-lt="section"><code>section</code> element</a> around a
						chapter to indicate it belongs to a part). All this practice does, however, is add repetition
						that is not only disruptive when reading but can make the structure of the publication harder to
						follow. It is therefore advised not to attempt to rebuild structures in these ways.</p>

					<p>For example, consider a book that has five parts and each part contains five chapters.
						Structurally, each chapter belongs to its part (i.e., is grouped with it), as in the following
						markup:</p>

					<pre>&lt;html … >
   …
   &lt;body>
      &lt;section
          role="doc-part"
          aria-labelledby="p1">
         
         &lt;h1 id="p1">Part 1&lt;/h1>
         
         &lt;section
             role="doc-chapter"
             aria-labelledby="c1">
            
            &lt;h2 id="c1">Chapter 1&lt;/h2>
            …

					<div class="note">
						<p>When more than one instance of a role is included in a document, each must be uniquely

							is omitted from the following examples.</p>

					<p>Since this would lead to a large content file, the part heading is typically split out into its

					<p>If another <code>section</code> tag were added around the chapter in the preceding example to

					<h4>Include EPUB landmarks</h4>

					<p>[[wai-aria]] <a data-cite="wai-aria#dfn-landmark">landmarks</a> are similar in nature to <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-landmarks">EPUB landmarks</a> [[epub-3]]: both are
						designed to provide users with quick access to the major structures of a document, such as
						chapters, glossaries and indexes.</p>

					<p>ARIA landmarks are compiled automatically by <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology"
							>assistive technologies</a> from the <a href="#roles-epub-type">roles</a> that have been
						applied to in an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
							document</a>, but this also means that ARIA landmarks are limited to how the EPUB
						publication has been chunked up. An assistive technology can only present the landmarks found in
						the currently-loaded document; it cannot provide a complete picture of all the landmarks in a
						multi-document publication (see the <a href="#role-repetition">previous section</a> for more
						discussion about content chunking).</p>

					<p>EPUB landmarks, on the other hand, are compiled prior to distribution, and are not directly
						linked to the use of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"
								><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[epub-3]] in the content. They are designed to
						simplify linking to major sections of the publication in a machine-readable way, as <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> do not scan
						the entire publication for landmarks, either. EPUB landmarks are typically not as numerous as
						ARIA landmarks, as reading systems only expose so many of these navigation aids.</p>

					<p>Given these differences in application, however, it is important to include EPUB landmarks and
						not rely only on the presence of ARIA roles to facilitate navigation, and vice versa. Each aids
						navigation in its own way.</p>

					<p>The EPUB specification does not require that EPUB publications include a specific set of
						landmarks, but it is recommended that they include a link to the start of the body matter as
						well as to any major reference sections (e.g., table of contents, endnotes, bibliography,
						glossary, index).</p>

					<h4>Include publication and document titles</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#page-titled">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> [[wcag2]] requires that each web
						page include a title. EPUB has a similar requirement for <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>: publications
						require a [[dcterms]] <code>title</code> element in the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> metadata. The
						[[wcag2]] requirement is not satisfied by the EPUB requirement, however.</p>

					<p>When authoring an EPUB publication each <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content document</a> also
						requires a descriptive title that describes its content. If not provided, <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> often will
						announce the name of the file to users.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Title for an EPUB content document">

					<h4>Ensure numbered headings reflect publication hierarchy</h4>

					<p>To a user, an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>
						appears as a single document that they read from beginning to end, even though the content is
						often split across numerous <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB
							content documents</a>. As a result, their natural expectation is that the headings reflect
						their position in the overall hierarchy of the publication, despite the publication not actually
						being a single document (e.g., if a part heading is expressed in an [[html]] <a data-lt="h1"
								><code>h1</code> element</a>, each chapter that belongs to the part will have an <a
							data-lt="h2"><code>h2</code></a> heading).</p>

					<p>Technique <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G141">G141: Organizing a page
							using headings</a> provides guidance on correctly using numbered headings within a document,
						but with EPUB publications the numbered headings also need to remain consistent across
						documents. Practically, this means that each EPUB content document does not have to begin with
						an <code>h1</code> heading unless the first heading is a top-level heading — the first heading
						needs to have a numbered heading element that reflects its actual position in the
						publication.</p>

					<p>EPUB publications should also be chunked so that the first heading in a document always has the
						highest number. For example, if a document starts with an <code>h3</code> heading, there should
						not be an <code>h2</code> heading later in the document (e.g., do not include the start of a new
						section with the trailing subsections of the previous). It is acceptable for there to be
						subsequent headings at the same level as the first (e.g., multiple subsections in one document
						could all have <code>h3</code> headings).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Heading order across documents">
						<p>In this example, there are two consecutive EPUB content documents in a textbook. The first
							contains the section heading (<code>h2</code>) and the first two subsections
								(<code>h3</code>). The second contains the final two subsections (<code>h3</code>).</p>

					<h4>Heading topic or purpose</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#non-text-content">Success Criterion 2.4.6</a> [[wcag2]] currently states that
						all headings must describe their topic or purpose. The implication of this wording is that all
						chapters in a novel, for example, have a topic or purpose and that the topic or purpose is
						always clearly reflected by the title of the chapter. Not only is this not always the case, but
						this success criterion also complicates the use of chapter numbers as headings since these do
						not establish a topic.</p>

					<p>After discussion in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/2039">Accessibility
							Guidelines Working Group's issue tracker</a>, it is clear that the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels">understanding
							document for 2.4.6</a> captures the intent of the success criterion better than the current
						wording &#8212; namely, that the requirement for headings is only that they establish a unique
						context for the content.</p>

					<p>By this interpretation, the headings in publications should always pass provided they are
						unique.</p>

					<p>It is expected that the wording of the success criterion will be updated to better reflect the
						uniqueness requirement, likely in the future WCAG 3 due the complexities of changing the wording
						for WCAG 2.</p>

							data-cite="wcag2#language-of-parts">3.1.2</a> [[wcag2]] deal with the language of a page and
						changes of language with in, respectively.</p>

					<p>For <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>, the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> is also an
						important source of metadata information about the publication. For example, <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> expose
						details of the publications to users in their bookshelves using this information.</p>

					<p>Consequently, it is necessary to provide the language of all text content in the package document
						to conform with these WCAG success criteria. The easiest way to meet this requirement is to add
						an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute on the root <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-package-elem"><code>package</code> element</a>
						[[epub-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="All text declared to be in Japanese by default">
						<pre><code>&lt;package … xml:lang="jp">
   …
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>If individual metadata fields within the package document are expressed in a different language,
						it is similarly required that the language change be identified by an <code>xml:lang</code>
						attribute on the element for the field.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Overriding the default language for a title">
						<pre><code>&lt;package … xml:lang="en">

      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Providing this information enables reading systems to correctly render the text content in the
						proper language for users.</p>

					<p class="note">The languages specified in the package document have no effect on individual EPUB
						content documents (i.e., the language of each document must be specified using the language
						expression mechanisms it provides).</p>

					<h4>Language of the EPUB publication</h4>

					<p>In addition to being able to express the language of text content, the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> also allows the
						identification of the languages of the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> in <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-opf-dclanguage"><code>dc:language</code> elements</a>

					<p>Although it is not strictly required to set this information to meet <a
							data-cite="wcag2#language-of-page">Success Criterion 3.1.1</a> [[wcag2]], as it is
						non-normative, it should be considered a best practice to always set this field with the proper
						language information. (Note that EPUB3 requires the language always be specified, so omitting
						will fail validation requirements.)</p>

					<p>Although <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> do not
						use this language information to render the text content of the EPUB publication, they do use it

						do not have a delay when synthesizing the text).</p>

					<p class="note">The languages specified in the package document have no effect on individual <a

				<h3>Text</h3>

					<span id="text-001"></span>
					<h4>Use Unicode for text content</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#non-text-content">Success Criterion 1.1.1</a> [[wcag2]] requires that text
						equivalents be provided for all non-text content to meet <a data-cite="wcag2#cc1_A">Level A</a>.
						In some regions (e.g., Asia), it is not uncommon to find images of individual text characters,
						despite the availability of Unicode character equivalents. This practice occurs for various
						reasons, such as ease of translation of older documents and for compatibility across <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a>. The use of
						images in most instances leads to the text not being accessible to non-visual users,
						however.</p>

					<p>When individual characters are replaced by images, there is invariably a negative effect on
						text-to-speech playback, even when alternative text is provided (e.g., if single characters
						within a word are replaced by images, the word will not be read as a single unit of text). It is
						also problematic for visual users, as the images often scale poorly and the characters cannot be
						changed to different font families to meet user preferences.</p>

					<p>The use of Unicode characters for all text content avoids this problem, allowing content to
						successfully meet the minimum requirement for Level A.</p>

					<p>For compliance with <a data-cite="wcag2#cc1_AA">Level AA</a>, please also refer to <a
							data-cite="wcag2#images-of-text">Success Criterion 1.4.5</a> which further restricts the use
						of images of text to only a set of essential cases.</p>

				<h3>Accessible alternatives</h3>

				<p>As <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> can be composed
					of more than one rendition, it is possible that different versions of the content will have
					different levels of accessibility. For example, an image-based version of the content that lacks
					alternative text or descriptions could be bundled with a WCAG-compliant text-based serialization.
					This type of accessible bundling is acceptable, as [[wcag2]] allows non-conforming content provided
					a <a data-cite="wcag2#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternate version</a> is
					available.</p>

				<p>The [[epub-multi-rend-11]] specification defines a set of features for creating these types of EPUB
					publications. It specifies a set of attributes that allow a <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> to automatically
					select a preferred rendition for the user or to provide the user the option to manually select
					between the available options. This functionality technically meets the requirements of [[wcag2]] in
					terms of ensuring the user can access the accessible version.</p>

				<p>In practice, however, the [[epub-multi-rend-11]] specification is not broadly supported in reading
					systems at the time of publication. As a result, a user who obtains an EPUB publication that
					contains more than one rendition will only have access to the default. Unless this rendition is the
					accessible one, the EPUB publication might not be readable by them.</p>

				<p>Using multiple renditions to meet accessibility requirements should only be done when there is no
					other alternative. EPUB publications that contain multiple renditions are conformant to the
					[[epub-a11y-12]] specification if at least one rendition meets all the content requirements, but
					such publications, at a minimum, need to note that a reading system that supports multiple
					renditions is required in their <a href="#accessibilitySummary">accessibility summary</a>. The use
					of methods outside the EPUB publication that can make this dependence known are also advisable
					(e.g., in the <a href="#dist-a11y-metadata">distribution metadata</a>).</p>

				<p>This section will be updated with techniques for using multiple renditions when there is enough
					support in reading systems to broadly recommend their use.</p>

					<h4>Provide page break markers</h4>

					<p>Both the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary [[epub-ssv]] and Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA 1.0

							data-cite="epub-ssv-11#pagebreak">pagebreak</a> and <a
							data-cite="dpub-aria-1.1#doc-pagebreak">doc-pagebreak</a>, respectively.</p>

					<p>For accessibility purposes, it is most important to specify the <code>role</code> attribute value
						as this is what <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a>
						will process. The <code>epub:type</code> attribute is not recognized by these devices, but it
						may be used by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">epub reading
							systems</a> to enhance the user experience. For compatibility with both types of devices, it
						is recommended to apply both attributes, although only the <code>role</code> attribute is
						strictly required for accessibility conformance.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expressing a page break">

					<h4>Identify pages in audio playback</h4>

					<p>Readers rarely stop reading to review each new page number, so when page numbers are read aloud

						(e.g., the number could be read out in the middle of a sentence).</p>

					<p>To mitigate this potential annoyance to readers, page announcements in <a

						playback experience where the numbers are automatically skipped.</p>

					<p>To identify page numbers in media overlay documents, attach an <code>epub:type</code> attribute
						with the value "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code></a>"

					<h4>Identify the pagination source</h4>

					<p>Users typically want to know the source of the page break markers included in an <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> when they are
						derived from a static media. Considerations like which printing, by which publisher or imprint,
						and whether the pagination comes from the hard or soft cover edition will affect decisions about
						its usefulness (e.g., does it exactly match the pagination of a print book used in a
						classroom).</p>

					<p>To allow users to determine the suitability of the pagination, identify the ISBN of the source
						work in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a>
						metadata using the <a href="epub-34#sec-pageBreakSource"><code>pageBreakSource</code>
							property</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expressing the source of pagination">
						<p>In this example, the <code>pageBreakSource</code> property contains the ISBN of the print
							source of pagination. (For EPUB 2, the <code>name</code> attribute would be used as it does
							not define a <code>property</code> attribute for <code>meta</code> tags.)</p>
						<pre>&lt;metadata …>
   …
   &lt;meta property="pageBreakSource">
      urn:isbn:9780375704024
   &lt;/meta>
   …
&lt;/metadata></pre>
					</aside>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-source-of"><code>source-of</code> property</a>
							was previously recommended in these techniques to identify the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-opf-dcmes-optional-def"><code>dc:source</code>
								element</a> containing the source of the pagination [[epub-3]]. This method came with a
							number of limitations, however. It was not future proof, for example, as it relied on the
							EPUB 3 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#attrdef-refines"><code>refines</code>
								attribute</a> [[epub-3]] and it could not handle pagination without a source due to the
							reliance on a <code>dc:source</code> element.</p>

						<p>The <a data-cite="epub-3#sec-pageBreakSource"><code>pageBreakSource</code> property</a>
							[[epub-3]] replaces <code>source-of</code> in newer version of EPUB 3. It is strongly
							recommended that anyone using the <code>source-of</code> property switch to using the
								<code>pageBreakSource</code> property. Although the <code>source-of</code> method will
							remain valid for backwards compatibility purposes, it is no longer recommended for new
							publications.</p>
					</div>

					<p>If an ISBN is not available, include as much information as possible about the source publication
						(e.g., the publisher, date, edition, and binding).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Text description of the source">

				<h3>Synchronized text-audio playback</h3>

				<section id="sync-coverage">
					<span id="sync-001"></span>
					<h4>Ensuring complete text coverage</h4>

					<p>Ensuring the complete text of an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publication</a> is synchronized with audio is key to allowing users who require full
						synchronized playback, or even audio-only playback, have access to the same information as users
						who do not require synchronized playback.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a>
						[[epub-3]] allows audio to be synchronized with any element in an <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content document</a>, so
						there is no technical barrier to providing synchronized playback.</p>

					<p>The primary consideration for this objective is what constitutes the text content of an EPUB
						publication. The minimal candidates for synchronization with audio are all the elements with
						visible text content.</p>

					<p>In HTML, the class of elements called [=palpable content=] [[html]] can typically be synchronized
						with audio or have their own built-in audio. Embedded text in SVG documents, on the other hand,
						is found in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#TextElement"><code>text</code>
							element</a> [[svg]] and its descendants.</p>

					<p>The media overlays <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-text-elem"><code>text</code>
							element</a> is used to reference these elements, either to play back the pre-recorded audio
						in a sibling <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-audio-elem"><code>audio</code>
							element</a> [[epub-3]] or to initiate playback of an audio or video element if the
							<code>audio</code> element is missing (e.g., for embedded audio and video in the
						document).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Media overlays should not synchronize to hidden text content. Synchronizing audio with
							invisible text will be confusing for sighted readers following the playback.</p>

						<p>Text content in a collapsed element, like the <a data-lt="details"><code>details</code>
								element</a> [[html]], is not considered hidden content.</p>
					</div>

					<p>In addition to synchronizing the visible text, synchronized text-audio playback must also address
						text alternatives for image-based content. Images may have alternative text and descriptions
						that are not visible to all users. As synchronization is also meant to aid users who cannot see
						the images, including these text alternatives and descriptions in the playback is essential to
						providing the user all the information in the EPUB publication.</p>

					<p>Text alternatives and descriptions in HTML may be represented in the <a
							data-cite="html#attr-img-alt"><code>alt</code> attribute</a> [[html]] and linked by ARIA
						attributes (e.g., <a data-cite="wai-aria#aria-describedby"><code>aria-describedby</code></a> and
							<a data-cite="wai-aria#aria-details"><code>aria-details</code></a> [[wai-aria]]).
						Descriptions for image elements in SVG are typically represented in a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#DescElement"><code>desc</code> element</a> but
						ARIA attributes may also be used.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sync-reading-order">
					<span id="sync-002"></span>
					<h4>Specifying the reading order</h4>

					<p>The default reading order should typically represent the order in which <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> render
						content to users during synchronized text-audio playback. For <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>, this is a
						combination of the sequence of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document"
							>EPUB content documents</a> in the spine and the order of elements within each EPUB content
						document.</p>

					<p>If there are cases where the logical reading order (how a reader would naturally read the
						content) diverges from the default reading order, order the playback sequence of <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"><code>seq</code></a> and <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-par-elem"><code>par</code></a> elements in a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-overlay-docs">media overlays document</a> [[epub-3]]
						to match the logical order.</p>

					<p>Use caution when making alterations, however, as other accessibility issues can arise when the
						logical order does not match the default order. For example, the content may not be accessible
						to users of <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> when
						the order in the markup does not match how the assistive technology reads the content. In these
						cases, using playback to create a logical order can make the EPUB publication fail WCAG
						conformance requirements.</p>

					<p>One case where the logical may diverge from the reading order and remain accessible is in tables,
						as assistive technologies typically allow users to choose whether to read by row or by
						column.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sync-skippability">
					<span id="sync-003"></span>
					<h4>Identifying skippable structures</h4>

					<p>Some content elements are not critical to read when following the primary narrative of a work,
						and that would interrupt a user's concentration if they had to stop and listen to. Footnotes and
						endnotes are examples of such content, as users may only want to come back and read this content
						after finishing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publication</a>. The announcement of page break numbers can be similarly annoying to
						readers.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a>
						[[epub-3]] does not allow <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
							systems</a> to determine if playback sequences are skippable unless additional semantics are
						added to the markup using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"
								><code>epub:type</code></a> attribute [[epub-3]] on <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"><code>seq</code></a> and <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-par-elem"><code>par</code></a> elements
						[[epub-3]]. These semantics are what allow reading systems to provide users the option to skip
						their playback sequences.</p>

					<p>The recommended structures to identify for skippability are:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Endnotes &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#endnotes"><code>endnotes</code></a> and
								<a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#endnote"><code>endnote</code></a> semantics [[epub-ssv-11]]
							for groups of notes and individual endnotes, respectively.</li>
						<li>Footnotes &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#footnotes"><code>footnotes</code></a>
							and <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#footnote"><code>footnote</code></a> semantics [[epub-ssv-11]]
							for groups of footnotes and individual footnotes, respectively.</li>
						<li>Page breaks &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code>
								semantic</a> [[epub-ssv-11]] to identify each.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The identification of other structures is encouraged but is not necessary to meet this
						requirement.</p>

					<h4>Identifying escapable structures</h4>

					<p>Some content elements are containers for expressing complex information. A table, for example,
						has data arranged in rows and cells. Lists similarly may contain many items. While users may be
						interested in some of the information in these structures, they also often want to escape from
						them to keep reading, not have to listen to the entire content before being able to move on.
						These are called escapable elements, because the user needs to be able to escape from them
						whenever they choose to simplify the reading experience.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a>
						[[epub-3]] only supports escapability if structural semantics are added to the markup using the
							<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"><code>epub:type</code>
							attribute</a> [[epub-3]] on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"
								><code>seq</code></a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"
								><code>par</code></a> elements [[epub-3]]. These semantics are what allow <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> to provide
						users the option to escape their playback sequences.</p>

					<p>The recommended structures to identify for escapability are:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Figures &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#figure"><code>figure</code> semantic</a>
							[[epub-ssv-11]] to identify each.</li>
						<li>Lists &#8212; using the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#list"><code>list</code> semantic</a>

					<h4>Synchronizing the navigation document</h4>

					<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">media overlay document</a> can
						be provided for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB
							navigation document</a> even when the navigation document is not included in the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-spine">spine</a>. Doing so allow <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> to announce
						the link labels regardless of how they present the navigation elements to users (e.g., many
						reading systems applications create custom table of contents panels by extracting the data from
						the EPUB navigation document).</p>

					<p>The process for adding a media overlay document is no different than one for any other
						document.</p>

				<h3>Do not restrict access through digital rights management</h3>

				<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> typically require
					preservation of the publisher's and author's intellectual property when distributed (e.g., so that
					they can be made available for individual sale through online bookstores or distributed through
					library systems). The most common way to address this need has been through the application of
					digital rights management (DRM) schemes to the packaged EPUB publication. DRM enables a variety of
					security features that aren't native to the EPUB format, such as the ability to limit access to a
					single user and to limit the length of time the person can access the publication (e.g., library
					loans).</p>

				<p>In general, DRM can be made to work interoperably with <a
						data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a>, but problems arise
					when DRM restrictions remove direct access to an EPUB publication or restrict access to the content
					within it. Unless the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
						system</a> implementing the DRM provides API level access to the content, it can prove
					difficult, or even impossible, to generate text-to-speech playback, or for a refreshable braille
					display to have access to the underlying text, as well as cause other accessibility issues.</p>

				<p>The application of digital rights management therefore must not impair or impede the functionality of
					assistive technologies on EPUB publications users have the right to access.</p>

				<h3>Include accessibility metadata in distribution records</h3>

				<p>When an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> is ingested
					into a distribution system, such as a bookstore or library, a metadata record is often provided
					separately to the distributor. In these scenarios, the metadata used to enable discovery of the
					publication typically comes from the distribution record alone, not from the metadata in the package
					document.</p>

				<p>The result is that it is necessary to include as much accessibility metadata in distribution records
					as their vocabularies allow.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The use of distribution records does not remove the requirement to include accessibility metadata
						in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a>. The
						metadata in the package document ensures accessibility information is always available with the
						publication.</p>
				</div>

				<aside class="example" title="ONIX accessibility metadata">
					<p>In this example, the ONIX record includes accessibility metadata that states that the EPUB
						publication has no accessibility features disabled (10), includes a table of contents (11) and
						has a correct reading order (13).</p>
