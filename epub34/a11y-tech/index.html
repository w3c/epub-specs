			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>This document, EPUB Accessibility Techniques, provides informative guidance on how to understand and
					apply the accessibility requirements defined in the EPUB Accessibility 1.2 specification
					[[epub-a11y-12]] that are unique to <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
					publications</a>.</p>

				<p>This document does not cover general web accessibility techniques already addressed in [[wcag2]] and
					[[wai-aria]], for example, for which no substantive differences in application exist. Following
					those techniques, as applicable, is also essential to meeting the accessibility requirements of the
					EPUB Accessibility 1.2 specification.</p>

				<p>This document is not intended to be read in isolation, in other words, as it does not define
					conformance requirements for making accessibility claims or cover every method for producing
					accessible content. An EPUB publication has to meet all the requirements of EPUB Accessibility 1.2
					to make a claim of accessibility; verifying only the techniques in this document is not
					sufficient.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This document uses terminology defined in <a data-cite="epub/#sec-terminology">EPUB 3.3</a> [[epub]]
					and <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#sec-terminology">EPUB Accessibility 1.2</a> [[epub-a11y-12]]:</p>

			<h2>About the techniques</h2>

			<p>The accessibility techniques described in this document are advisory in nature. They are intended to help
				create <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> that conform to the requirements
				in [[epub-a11y-12]], but they are not all applicable in all situations and there can be other ways to
				meet the requirements of that specification. As a result, this document is not intended to be read as
				providing prescriptive requirements.</p>

			<p>These techniques also do not address issues in digital publishing for which no universally accessible
				solutions exist. The W3C's Digital Publishing Interest Group has published a note that outlines many of
				these issues [[dpub-accessibility]]. As solutions become available, they will be incorporated into the
				appropriate document, whether this one or one it refers to.</p>

			<p>When encountering issues that are not covered in these or related techniques, please report an issue to
				the appropriate community for guidance on how to meet accessibility standards. The <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/">W3C Web Accessibility Interest Group</a> has a public mailing list
				where issues meeting [[wcag2]] and [[wai-aria]] requirements can be raised. The <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/issues">W3C Publishing Community Group issue tracker</a> can
				be used to ask for support implementing EPUB-specific requirements and the <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues">EPUB 3 Working Group's issue tracker</a> to report
				issues with this document.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Accessibility metadata techniques are no longer covered by this guide. For information on how to
					apply accessibility metadata, please refer to the <a

			<h2>WCAG techniques</h2>

			<section id="sec-wcag-general">
				<h3>General guidance</h3>

				<p>Techniques for meeting the requirements of the [[wcag2]] are defined in <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/">Techniques for WCAG</a>. This document does not
					repeat those techniques.</p>

				<p>In general, the differences between the application of WCAG techniques to web pages and their
					application to <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a> is minimal,
					but the following sections outline some key differences.</p>

				<p>One point to note is that the WCAG techniques cover a greater range of technologies and content types
					than are typically found in an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>, so
					many are not applicable.</p>

				<p>The following sets of techniques are the most applicable to EPUB content documents:</p>

				<ul>

							<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/#aria">ARIA Techniques</a>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Other techniques could apply depending on the content of the EPUB publication (e.g., the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/#pdf">PDF Tecnhiques</a> would apply if there are
					embedded PDF forms).</p>

				<section id="sec-wcag-general-res">
					<h4>Helpful resources</h4>

					<p>Anyone unfamiliar with [[wcag2]] might find the number of techniques daunting, as they are
						intended to provide broad coverage of possible solutions.</p>

					<p>Assistance applying these techniques to EPUB content documents is available from the following
						sources:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p><a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/">DAISY Accessible Publishing Knowledge
									Base</a> — compendium of best practices by content type, with links to the
								applicable WCAG techniques.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><a href="https://www.bisg.org/products/bisg-guide-to-accessible-publishing--cheat-sheets"
									>BISG Guide to Accessible Publishing &amp; Cheat Sheets</a> — includes a set of top
								practices for making content accessible.</p>

			<section id="sec-wcag-content-access">
				<h3>Content access</h3>

				<section id="spread-order">
					<span id="access-001"></span>
					<h4>Ensure meaningful order of content across spreads</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#meaningful-sequence">Success Criterion 1.3.2</a> [[wcag2]] specifies that
						each web page have a meaningful order (i.e., that the visual presentation of the content match
						the underlying markup).</p>

					<p>As EPUB allows two <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a> to
						be rendered together in a <a data-cite="epub/#spread">synthetic spread</a> [[epub]], the order
						of content within a single document cannot always be evaluated in isolation. Content might span
						visually from one document to the next. For example, a sidebar might span the bottom of two
						pages.</p>

					<p>Ordering each document separately by the visual display will lead to users of <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> encountering
						gaps between the start and end of the spanned text. If the markup cannot be arranged to provide
						a more logical reading experience (e.g., the beginning of the spanned content at the end of the
						first page followed by the conclusion at the start of the next), another means of satisfying
						this criteria will be necessary to avoid failure (e.g., a hyperlink could be provided to allow a
						user to jump from the break point on the first page to the continuation on the next).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="multiple-ways">
					<span id="access-002"></span>
					<h4>Provide multiple ways to access the content</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#multiple-ways">Success Criterion 2.4.5</a> [[wcag2]] requires there be more
						than one way to locate a web page within a set of web pages. By default, <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> meet this WCAG requirement so
						long as <a data-cite="epub/#sec-spine-elem">all EPUB content documents are included in the
							spine</a> and <a data-cite="epub/#sec-itemref-elem">access to all non-linear documents is
							provided</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

					<p>The reason an EPUB publication passes by meeting these requirements has to do with differences in
						how a user interacts with the set of documents in an EPUB publication. In particular, although
						an EPUB publication typically consists of many <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document"
							>EPUB content documents</a>, <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
							systems</a> automatically provide the ability for the user to move seamlessly from one
						document to the next, so long as they are listed in the <a data-cite="epub/#sec-spine-elem"
							>spine</a> [[epub]]. To the user, an EPUB publication is a single document they have
						complete access to, not a set of disconnected pages that they need links to move through.</p>

					<p>The required table of contents provides a second method to access the major headings of the
						publication. The user can jump to any heading and continue to navigate from there, regardless of
						how the publication is chunked.</p>

					<p>Following these two requirements therefore satisfies the need for multiple ways to access the
						content. Reading systems also typically provide search capabilities so users also have a third
						option available in most cases.</p>

					<p>Although following EPUB's basic requirements will meet this criterion, providing additional
						methods to improve access beyond the minimum is encouraged. Some suggestions include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>adding at least one link to every EPUB content document in the spine to the table of
								contents, when feasible;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>adding an index to locate major topics; and</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>adding additional navigation aids to the <a
									data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation document</a> (e.g.,
								lists of figures and tables).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<section id="sec-access-002-toc">
						<h5>Note about the table of contents</h5>

						<p>A common question about the EPUB table of contents is what completeness it needs to have with
							respect to the headings of the publication. Although the obvious answer is to create a
							simple aggregation of all the headings for all the sections, practically there are several
							usability challenges to this approach.</p>

						<p>Factors such as device screen sizes can make the table of contents for publications with a
							deep hierarchy of headings unreadable, so headings below a certain depth get trimmed to
							improve the readability. Further, <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
								systems</a> do not always provide structured access to the headings in the table of
							contents, or provide shortcuts to navigate the links. The result is that users have to
							listen to each link one at a time to find where they want to go, a tedious and
							time-consuming process.</p>

						<p>Although it is expected that reading systems will improve access to the table of contents as
							accessibility support for EPUB evolves — making complete tables of contents usable by
							everyone — there are legitimate usability reasons why they are not provided now.</p>

						<p>When opting not to provide links to all the headings, it is best to optimize the links that
							are provided to improve the overall reading experience. Some considerations on how to
							achieve this include:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>ensuring that there is at least one link to every <a
										data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content document</a> — allowing
									the user to reach each document simplifies navigation to the minor headings within
									them; and</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>only omitting minor headings from the table of contents — although a subjective
									decision, there is often a level of diminishing value for navigation (e.g., fourth
									level and lower headings often only delimit short subsections on a topic).</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section id="toc-linear-order">
					<span id="access-003"></span>
					<h4>Ensure the order of table of contents entries matches linear order</h4>

					<p>The table of contents provides users more than just links into the content. It is also a means to
						understand the structure and ordering of an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publication</a>. Consequently, users might have difficulty locating where they are in a
						publication, where they want to go, and also how to return to previous locations when the order
						of entries in the table of contents does not match the linear reading order.</p>

					<p>To ensure that the table of contents matches the linear order of the content, the order of its
						entries needs to reflect both:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the order of <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a> in
							the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-spine">spine</a>; and</li>
						<li>the order of each referenced section within its respective EPUB content document.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Only if there is a logical case for an alternative arrangement of entries is it advised that the
						ordering differ. Such scenarios typically only occur when the content does not have to be read
						linearly or when additional information is included at the end of a table of contents. For
						example, the table of contents for a magazine might be ordered to list all the major articles
						first, followed by features, etc.</p>

					<p>When the ordering of the table of contents does not match the content, the <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/publ-a11y/epub-a11y-meta-guide/1.0/draft/#accessibilitySummary"
							>accessibility summary</a> needs to explain why.</p>

					<p>Avoid linking directly to supplementary content from of the table of contents. Instead, define
						navigation lists to group together related links, such as a table of figures or a table of
						illustrations. These types of lists can be created using <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-nav-def-types-other">custom <code>nav</code> elements</a> [[epub-3]] in
						the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation document</a> or using
						navigation lists in XHTML content documents. When these navigation lists are included in the
							<code>spine</code>, the table of contents can link users to them.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Reading systems do not always provide users an interface to access to custom <code>nav</code>
							elements in the EPUB navigation document. Consequently, when using the navigation document
							to add supplementary content lists, it is best to ensure the document is also included in
							the spine.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="access-bypass-blocks">
					<h4>Bypass blocks not necessary</h4>

					<p>Web sites are constructed very differently from EPUB publications. A typical web site wraps the
						content of each page within a repeating template, for example. This template gives each page a
						consistent look and feel, but users are rarely interested in the wrapper content after visiting
						the first page. Visual readers can typically skip past the site header, navigation bars, search
						boxes, and other helpful but seldom-used features to get right to the content.</p>

					<p>To provide the same ease of access to readers who would have to navigate sequentially through the
						repetitive content, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#bypass-blocks">success criterion
							2.4.1</a> [[wcag2]] requires a means of bypassing the repeated content in a set of pages.
						This success criterion does not apply to typical EPUB publications, however, as EPUB content
						documents do not repeat content in the same way that web sites do.</p>

					<p>Each new content document might begin with similar content, such as learning objectives or key
						terms, but this content is part of the body of the publication and not identical to what came
						before. Consequently, it is not required to add a link to skip it. (Secondary content still
						needs to be identified in accordance with <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#info-and-relationships">success criterion 1.3.1</a>,
						however.)</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>If an EPUB publication were to reproduce a set of web pages with their full site trappings,
							then success criterion 2.4.1 would apply, but this practice is not common.</p>
					</div>

			<section id="sec-wcag-roles">
				<h3>Roles</h3>

				<section id="roles-epub-type">
					<span id="sem-001"></span>
					<h4>ARIA roles and <code>epub:type</code></h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The following guidance is only for <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB
								content documents</a>. The <code>type</code> attribute is the only means of adding
							structural information to <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">media overlay
								documents</a> so that features like lists and tables can be navigated more efficiently.
							It is also required in the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation
								document</a> to identify key structures.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Although the <code>role</code> attribute might seem similar in nature to the <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[epub]], their
						target uses in EPUB content documents do not overlap.</p>

					<p>The key difference between these attributes is that the <code>role</code> attribute bridges
						accessibility in content while the <code>type</code> attribute provides hooks to enable <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> behaviors. Omitting roles
						lessens the accessibility for users of <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology"
							>assistive technologies</a>, in other words, while omitting types diminishes certain
						functionality in <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> (e.g., pop-up
						footnotes or special presentations of the content).</p>

					<p>Since each attribute offers different advantages, it is only necessary to pair them together when
						both attributes provide benefits. For example, it is common to pair footnote roles and types to
						ensure reading systems can provide pop-up functionality and assistive technologies can announce
						the type of link the user has encountered.</p>

					<p>For anyone looking to move from the <code>type</code> attribute to using ARIA roles, the <a
							href="https://idpf.github.io/epub-guides/epub-aria-authoring/">EPUB Type to ARIA Role
							Authoring Guide</a> details notable authoring differences between the two attributes. It
						also includes a mapping table of semantics in the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary to
						equivalent ARIA roles in [[dpub-aria-1.1]] and [[wai-aria]]. [[html-aria]] is another useful
						reference that provides the full list of restrictions on where ARIA roles can be used in
						HTML.</p>

					<p>Finally, be aware that the use of the <code>type</code> attribute is not a means of satisfying
						requirements for ARIA roles in WCAG.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="role-repetition">
					<span id="sem-002"></span>
					<h4>Do not repeat roles across chunked content</h4>

					<p>Although <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> appear as single
						contiguous documents to users when read, they are typically composed of many individual <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>. This practice keeps
						the amount of markup that has to be rendered small to reduce the load time in <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> (i.e., to minimize the time
						the user has to wait for a document to appear). It is rare, at least for books, for an EPUB
						publication to contain only one EPUB content document with all the content in it.</p>

					<p>When content is chunked in this way, it often requires restructuring the information to fit
						within the new file structure. A part, for example, will typically not include all the chapters
						that belong to it. Instead, the part heading might be separated from each chapter, leaving each
						chapter in a separate document.</p>

					<p>Although visually these restructuring decisions can be hidden from readers, they impact the
						functionality of <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive
						technologies</a>. In the case of [[wai-aria]] roles, the result is that only the subset present
						in the currently-loaded EPUB content document are exposed to users. An assistive technology
						cannot provide a list of landmarks for the whole publication, as it cannot see outside the
						current document.</p>

					<p>To counteract this destructuring effect, a common bad practice is to re-add or re-identify
						structures in the belief that having this information in every document will be helpful to users
						(e.g., adding an extra [[html]] <a data-lt="section"><code>section</code> element</a> around a
						chapter to indicate it belongs to a part). All this practice does, however, is add repetition
						that is not only disruptive when reading but can make the structure of the publication harder to
						follow. It is therefore advised not to attempt to rebuild structures in these ways.</p>

					<p>For example, consider a book that has five parts and each part contains five chapters.
						Structurally, each chapter belongs to its part (i.e., is grouped with it), as in the following
						markup:</p>

					<pre>&lt;html … >
   …
   &lt;body>
      &lt;section
          role="doc-part"
          aria-labelledby="p1">
         
         &lt;h1 id="p1">Part 1&lt;/h1>
         
         &lt;section
             role="doc-chapter"
             aria-labelledby="c1">
            
            &lt;h2 id="c1">Chapter 1&lt;/h2>
            …
         &lt;/section>
         …
      &lt;/section>
      …
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

					<div class="note">
						<p>When more than one instance of a role is included in a document, each has to be uniquely
							identified. The <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute provides the name of each landmark in
							the preceding example. The attribute is not required if only one instance is present, so it
							is omitted from the following examples.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Since this would lead to a large content file, the part heading is typically split out into its
						own EPUB content document so that it will appear on its own page:</p>

					<pre>&lt;html … >
   …
   &lt;body>
      &lt;section 
          role="doc-part">
         &lt;h1 id="p1">Part 1&lt;/h1>
      &lt;/section>
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

					<p>Each chapter is then separated into a separate EPUB content document:</p>

					<h4>Include EPUB landmarks</h4>

					<p>[[wai-aria]] <a data-cite="wai-aria#dfn-landmark">landmarks</a> are similar in nature to <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-nav-landmarks">EPUB landmarks</a> [[epub-3]]: both are designed to
						provide users with quick access to the major structures of a document, such as chapters,
						glossaries and indexes.</p>

					<p>ARIA landmarks are compiled automatically by <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology"
							>assistive technologies</a> from the <a href="#roles-epub-type">roles</a> that have been
						applied to in an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
							document</a>, but this also means that ARIA landmarks are limited to how the EPUB
						publication has been chunked up. An assistive technology can only present the landmarks found in
						the currently-loaded document; it cannot provide a complete picture of all the landmarks in a
						multi-document publication (see the <a href="#role-repetition">previous section</a> for more
						discussion about content chunking).</p>

					<p>EPUB landmarks, on the other hand, are compiled prior to distribution, and are not directly
						linked to the use of the <a data-cite="epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"
							><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[epub-3]] in the content. They are designed to simplify
						linking to major sections of the publication in a machine-readable way, as <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> do not scan the entire
						publication for landmarks, either. EPUB landmarks are typically not as numerous as ARIA
						landmarks, as reading systems only expose so many of these navigation aids.</p>

					<p>Given these differences in application, however, it is important to include EPUB landmarks and
						not rely only on the presence of ARIA roles to facilitate navigation, and vice versa. Each aids
						navigation in its own way.</p>

					<p>The EPUB specification does not require that EPUB publications include a specific set of
						landmarks; it only recommends to include a link to the start of the body matter as well as to
						any major reference sections (e.g., table of contents, endnotes, bibliography, glossary,
						index).</p>

					<h4>Include publication and document titles</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#page-titled">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> [[wcag2]] requires that each web
						page include a title. EPUB has a similar requirement for <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>: publications require a
							[[dcterms]] <code>title</code> element in the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-package-document"
							>package document</a> metadata. The [[wcag2]] requirement is not satisfied by the EPUB
						requirement, however.</p>

					<p>When authoring an EPUB publication each <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB
							content document</a> also requires a descriptive title that describes its content. If not
						provided, <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> often
						will announce the name of the file to users.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Title for an EPUB content document">
						<pre>&lt;html …>

					<p>If the title includes structural context (e.g., the part heading a chapter belongs to, or the

					<h4>Ensure numbered headings reflect publication hierarchy</h4>

					<p>To a user, an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> appears as a single
						document that they read from beginning to end, even though the content is often split across
						numerous <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>. As a result,
						their natural expectation is that the headings reflect their position in the overall hierarchy
						of the publication, despite the publication not actually being a single document (e.g., if a
						part heading is expressed in an [[html]] <a data-lt="h1"><code>h1</code> element</a>, each
						chapter that belongs to the part will have an <a data-lt="h2"><code>h2</code></a> heading).</p>

					<p>Technique <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G141">G141: Organizing a page
							using headings</a> provides guidance on correctly using numbered headings within a document,
						but with EPUB publications the numbered headings also need to remain consistent across
						documents. Practically, this means that each EPUB content document does not have to begin with
						an <code>h1</code> heading unless the first heading is a top-level heading — the first heading
						needs to have a numbered heading element that reflects its actual position in the
						publication.</p>

					<p>It is advised to chunk EPUB publications so that the first heading in a document always has the
						highest number. For example, if a document starts with an <code>h3</code> heading,
							an <code>h1</code> or <code>h2</code> heading does not appear later in the document (e.g.,
						do not include the start of a new section with the trailing subsections of the previous). It is
						acceptable for there to be subsequent headings at the same level as the first (e.g., multiple
						subsections in one document could all have <code>h3</code> headings).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Heading order across documents">
						<p>In this example, there are two consecutive EPUB content documents in a textbook. The first
							contains the section heading (<code>h2</code>) and the first two subsections
								(<code>h3</code>). The second contains the final two subsections (<code>h3</code>).</p>

					<h4>Heading topic or purpose</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#non-text-content">Success Criterion 2.4.6</a> [[wcag2]] currently states that
						all headings have to describe their topic or purpose. The implication of this wording is that
						all chapters in a novel, for example, have a topic or purpose and that the topic or purpose is
						always clearly reflected by the title of the chapter. Not only is this not always the case, but
						this success criterion also complicates the use of chapter numbers as headings since these do
						not establish a topic.</p>

					<p>After discussion in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/2039">Accessibility
							Guidelines Working Group's issue tracker</a>, it is clear that the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels">understanding
							document for 2.4.6</a> captures the intent of the success criterion better than the current
						wording &#8212; namely, that the requirement for headings is only that they establish a unique
						context for the content.</p>

					<p>By this interpretation, the headings in publications always pass provided they are unique.</p>

					<p>It is expected that the wording of the success criterion will be updated to better reflect the
						uniqueness requirement, likely in the future WCAG 3 due the complexities of changing the wording
						for WCAG 2.</p>

					<h4>Language of package document</h4>

					<p>Success Criterions <a data-cite="wcag2#language-of-page">3.1.1</a> and <a
							data-cite="wcag2#language-of-parts">3.1.2</a> [[wcag2]] deal with the language of a page and
						changes of language with in, respectively.</p>

					<p>For <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>, the <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> is also an important source of
						metadata information about the publication. For example, <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> expose details of the
						publications to users in their bookshelves using this information.</p>

					<p>Consequently, it is necessary to provide the language of all text content in the package document
						to conform with these WCAG success criteria. The easiest way to meet this requirement is to add
						an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute on the root <a data-cite="epub/#sec-package-elem"
								><code>package</code> element</a> [[epub]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="All text declared to be in Japanese by default">
						<pre><code>&lt;package … xml:lang="jp">
   …
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>If individual metadata fields within the package document are expressed in a different language,
						it is similarly required that the language change be identified by an <code>xml:lang</code>
						attribute on the element for the field.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Overriding the default language for a title">
						<pre><code>&lt;package … xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata …>

      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Providing this information enables reading systems to correctly render the text content in the
						proper language for users.</p>

					<p class="note">The languages specified in the package document have no effect on individual EPUB
						content documents (i.e., the language of each document has to be specified using the language
						expression mechanisms it provides).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="publication-lang">
					<span id="lang-002"></span>
					<h4>Language of the EPUB publication</h4>

					<p>In addition to being able to express the language of text content, the <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> also allows the identification
						of the languages of the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> in <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-opf-dclanguage"><code>dc:language</code> elements</a> [[epub]].</p>

					<p>Although it is not strictly required to set this information to meet <a
							data-cite="wcag2#language-of-page">Success Criterion 3.1.1</a> [[wcag2]], as it is
						non-normative, it is best practice to always set this field with the proper language
						information. (Note that EPUB3 requires the language always be specified, so omitting will fail
						validation requirements.)</p>

					<p>Although <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> do not use this
						language information to render the text content of the EPUB publication, they do use it to
						optimize the reading experience for users (e.g., to preload text-to-speech engines so users do
						not have a delay when synthesizing the text).</p>

					<p class="note">The languages specified in the package document have no effect on individual <a

				<h3>Text</h3>

					<h4>Use Unicode for text content</h4>

					<p><a data-cite="wcag2#non-text-content">Success Criterion 1.1.1</a> [[wcag2]] requires that text
						equivalents be provided for all non-text content to meet <a data-cite="wcag2#cc1_A">Level A</a>.
						In some regions (e.g., Asia), it is not uncommon to find images of individual text characters,
						despite the availability of Unicode character equivalents. This practice occurs for various
						reasons, such as ease of translation of older documents and for compatibility across <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a>. The use of images in most
						instances leads to the text not being accessible to non-visual users, however.</p>

					<p>When individual characters are replaced by images, there is invariably a negative effect on
						text-to-speech playback, even when alternative text is provided (e.g., if single characters
						within a word are replaced by images, the word will not be read as a single unit of text). It is
						also problematic for visual users, as the images often scale poorly and the characters cannot be
						changed to different font families to meet user preferences.</p>

					<p>The use of Unicode characters for all text content avoids this problem, allowing content to
						successfully meet the minimum requirement for Level A.</p>

					<p>For compliance with <a data-cite="wcag2#cc1_AA">Level AA</a>, please also refer to <a
							data-cite="wcag2#images-of-text">Success Criterion 1.4.5</a> which further restricts the use
						of images of text to only a set of essential cases.</p>

				<h3>Accessible alternatives</h3>

				<p>As <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> can be composed of more than one
					rendition, it is possible that different versions of the content will have different levels of
					accessibility. For example, an image-based version of the content that lacks alternative text or
					descriptions could be bundled with a WCAG-compliant text-based serialization. This type of
					accessible bundling is acceptable, as [[wcag2]] allows non-conforming content provided a <a
						data-cite="wcag2#dfn-conforming-alternate-versions">conforming alternate version</a> is
					available.</p>

				<p>The [[epub-multi-rend-11]] specification defines a set of features for creating these types of EPUB
					publications. It specifies a set of attributes that allow a <a
						data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> to automatically select a preferred
					rendition for the user or to provide the user the option to manually select between the available
					options. This functionality technically meets the requirements of [[wcag2]] in terms of ensuring the
					user can access the accessible version.</p>

				<p>In practice, however, the [[epub-multi-rend-11]] specification is not broadly supported in reading
					systems at the time of publication. As a result, a user who obtains an EPUB publication that
					contains more than one rendition will only have access to the default. Unless this rendition is the
					accessible one, the EPUB publication might not be readable by them.</p>

				<p>Using multiple renditions to meet accessibility requirements is only advised when there is no other
					alternative. EPUB publications that contain multiple renditions are conformant to the
					[[epub-a11y-12]] specification if at least one rendition meets all the content requirements, but
					such publications, at a minimum, need to note that a reading system that supports multiple
					renditions is required in their <a
						href="https://w3c.github.io/publ-a11y/epub-a11y-meta-guide/1.0/draft/#accessibilitySummary"
						>accessibility summary</a>. The use of methods outside the EPUB publication that can make this
					dependence known are also advisable (e.g., in the <a href="#dist-a11y-metadata">distribution
						metadata</a>).</p>

				<p>This section will be updated with techniques for using multiple renditions when there is enough
					support in reading systems to broadly recommend their use.</p>

					<h4>Provide page break markers</h4>

					<p>Both the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary [[epub-ssv]] and Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA 1.0
						Module [[dpub-aria-1.1]] include a semantic for static page breaks: <a
							data-cite="epub-ssv-11#pagebreak">pagebreak</a> and <a
							data-cite="dpub-aria-1.1#doc-pagebreak">doc-pagebreak</a>, respectively.</p>

					<p>For accessibility purposes, it is most important to specify the <code>role</code> attribute value
						as this is what <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a>
						will process. The <code>epub:type</code> attribute is not recognized by these devices, but it
						could be used by <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">epub reading systems</a> to
						enhance the user experience. For compatibility with both types of devices, it is advised to
						apply both attributes, although only the <code>role</code> attribute is strictly required for
						accessibility conformance.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expressing a page break">
						<p>In this example, the HTML <code>span</code> element is identified as a page break.</p>
						<pre>&lt;span
    id="page001"

    role="doc-pagebreak"
    aria-label="1"/></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>A <code>title</code> or <code>aria-label</code> attribute is required on the element, as it
						provides the value that is announced to the user.</p>

					<p>The page number can be inserted as text content within the element, but assistive technologies
						might not provide a way to disable announcing of the numbers. As a result, users might hear the
						numbers announced wherever they occur, which could cause confusion (e.g., the number might seem
						to be part of the sentence it occurs within).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Text page break">
						<pre>&lt;p>With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself

					</aside>

					<p>EPUB 2 does not include markup to identify static page break marks in the content. Page break
						destinations can be included to enable hyperlinking, but the <a href="#pageList">page
						list</a> is the only way a user can jump to the locations.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Adding a hyperlink destination in EPUB 2">
						<p>In this example, an XHTML 1.1 <code>span</code> element is used as a hyperlink

					<p>Do not use the [[html]] <a data-lt="a"><code>a</code> element</a> to identify page break

					<h4>Identify pages in audio playback</h4>

					<p>Readers rarely stop reading to review each new page number, so when page numbers are read aloud
						in the audio playback of a publication it is not only distracting, but can be confusing, as well
						(e.g., the number could be read out in the middle of a sentence).</p>

					<p>To mitigate this potential annoyance to readers, it is advised to identify page announcements in
							<a data-cite="epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">media overlay documents</a> when they are
						included. Identification allows a <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
							system</a> to provide a playback experience where the numbers are automatically skipped.</p>

					<p>To identify page numbers in media overlay documents, attach an <code>epub:type</code> attribute
						with the value "<a data-cite="epub-ssv-11/#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code></a>" [[epub-ssv]]
						to each <a data-cite="epub#sec-smil-par-elem"><code>par</code> element</a> [[epub]] that
						identifies a page number.</p>

					<h4>Identify the pagination source</h4>

					<p>Users typically want to know the source of the page break markers included in an <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> when they are derived from a
						static media. Considerations like which printing, by which publisher or imprint, and whether the
						pagination comes from the hard or soft cover edition will affect decisions about its usefulness
						(e.g., does it exactly match the pagination of a print book used in a classroom).</p>

					<p>To allow users to determine the suitability of the pagination, identify the ISBN of the source
						work in the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> metadata using the <a
							data-cite="epub#sec-pageBreakSource"><code>pageBreakSource</code> property</a> [[epub]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expressing the source of pagination">
						<p>In this example, the <code>pageBreakSource</code> property contains the ISBN of the print
							source of pagination. (For EPUB 2, the <code>name</code> attribute would be used as it does
							not define a <code>property</code> attribute for <code>meta</code> tags.)</p>
						<pre>&lt;metadata …>
   …
   &lt;meta property="pageBreakSource">
      urn:isbn:9780375704024

						<p>These techniques previously advised using the <a data-cite="epub/#sec-source-of"
									><code>source-of</code> property</a> to identify the <a
								data-cite="epub/#sec-opf-dcmes-optional-def"><code>dc:source</code> element</a>
							containing the source of the pagination [[epub]]. This method came with a number of
							limitations, however. It was not future proof, for example, as it relied on the EPUB 3 <a
								data-cite="epub/#attrdef-refines"><code>refines</code> attribute</a> [[epub]] and it
							could not handle pagination without a source due to the reliance on a <code>dc:source</code>
							element.</p>

						<p>The <a data-cite="epub#sec-pageBreakSource"><code>pageBreakSource</code> property</a>
							[[epub]] replaces <code>source-of</code> in newer version of EPUB 3. It is strongly advised
							that anyone using the <code>source-of</code> property switch to using the
								<code>pageBreakSource</code> property. Although the <code>source-of</code> method will
							remain valid for backwards compatibility purposes, its use is no longer advised.</p>
					</div>

					<p>If an ISBN is not available, include as much information as possible about the source publication

				<h3>Synchronized text-audio playback</h3>

				<section id="sync-coverage">
					<span id="sync-001"></span>
					<h4>Ensuring complete text coverage</h4>

					<p>Ensuring the complete text of an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>
						is synchronized with audio is key to allowing users who require full synchronized playback, or
						even audio-only playback, have access to the same information as users who do not require
						synchronized playback.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a data-cite="epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a> [[epub]] allows audio
						to be synchronized with any element in an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB
							content document</a>, so there is no technical barrier to providing synchronized
						playback.</p>

					<p>The primary consideration for this objective is what constitutes the text content of an EPUB
						publication. The minimal candidates for synchronization with audio are all the elements with
						visible text content.</p>

					<p>In HTML, the class of elements called [=palpable content=] [[html]] can typically be synchronized
						with audio or have their own built-in audio. Embedded text in SVG documents, on the other hand,
						is found in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#TextElement"><code>text</code>
							element</a> [[svg]] and its descendants.</p>

					<p>The media overlays <a data-cite="epub/#sec-smil-text-elem"><code>text</code> element</a> is used
						to reference these elements, either to play back the pre-recorded audio in a sibling <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-smil-audio-elem"><code>audio</code> element</a> [[epub]] or to initiate
						playback of an audio or video element if the <code>audio</code> element is missing (e.g., for
						embedded audio and video in the document).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Do not synchronize media overlays to hidden text content. Synchronizing audio with invisible
							text will be confusing for sighted readers following the playback.</p>

						<p>Text content in a collapsed element, like the <a data-lt="details"><code>details</code>
								element</a> [[html]], is not considered hidden content.</p>
					</div>

					<p>In addition to synchronizing the visible text, synchronized text-audio playback also has to
						address text alternatives for image-based content. Images can have alternative text and
						descriptions that are not visible to all users. As synchronization is also meant to aid users
						who cannot see the images, including these text alternatives and descriptions in the playback is
						essential to providing the user all the information in the EPUB publication.</p>

					<p>Text alternatives and descriptions in HTML can be represented in the <a
							data-cite="html#attr-img-alt"><code>alt</code> attribute</a> [[html]] and linked by ARIA
						attributes (e.g., <a data-cite="wai-aria#aria-describedby"><code>aria-describedby</code></a> and
							<a data-cite="wai-aria#aria-details"><code>aria-details</code></a> [[wai-aria]]).
						Descriptions for image elements in SVG are typically represented in a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#DescElement"><code>desc</code> element</a> but
						ARIA attributes can also be used.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sync-reading-order">
					<span id="sync-002"></span>
					<h4>Specifying the reading order</h4>

					<p>The default reading order typically represents the order in which <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> render content to users during
						synchronized text-audio playback. For <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publications</a>, this is a combination of the sequence of <a
							data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a> in the spine and the
						order of elements within each EPUB content document.</p>

					<p>If there are cases where the logical reading order (how a reader would naturally read the
						content) diverges from the default reading order, order the playback sequence of <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"><code>seq</code></a> and <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-smil-par-elem"><code>par</code></a> elements in a <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-overlay-docs">media overlays document</a> [[epub]] to match the logical
						order.</p>

					<p>Use caution when making alterations, however, as other accessibility issues can arise when the
						logical order does not match the default order. For example, the content might not be accessible
						to users of <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> when
						the order in the markup does not match how the assistive technology reads the content. In these
						cases, using playback to create a logical order can make the EPUB publication fail WCAG
						conformance requirements.</p>

					<p>One case where the logical order can diverge from the reading order and remain accessible is in
						tables, as assistive technologies typically allow users to choose whether to read by row or by
						column.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sync-skippability">
					<span id="sync-003"></span>
					<h4>Identifying skippable structures</h4>

					<p>Some content elements are not critical to read when following the primary narrative of a work,
						and that would interrupt a user's concentration if they had to stop and listen to. Footnotes and
						endnotes are examples of such content, as users might only want to come back and read this
						content after finishing the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>. The
						announcement of page break numbers can be similarly annoying to readers.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a data-cite="epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a> [[epub]] does not
						allow <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> to determine if playback
						sequences are skippable unless additional semantics are added to the markup using the <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"><code>epub:type</code></a> attribute [[epub]] on
							<a data-cite="epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"><code>seq</code></a> and <a
							data-cite="epub/#sec-smil-par-elem"><code>par</code></a> elements [[epub]]. These semantics
						are what allow reading systems to provide users the option to skip their playback sequences.</p>

					<p>It is strongly advised to identify the following structures for skippability:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Endnotes &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#endnotes"><code>endnotes</code></a> and
								<a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#endnote"><code>endnote</code></a> semantics [[epub-ssv-11]]
							for groups of notes and individual endnotes, respectively.</li>
						<li>Footnotes &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#footnotes"><code>footnotes</code></a>
							and <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#footnote"><code>footnote</code></a> semantics [[epub-ssv-11]]
							for groups of footnotes and individual footnotes, respectively.</li>
						<li>Page breaks &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code>
								semantic</a> [[epub-ssv-11]] to identify each.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The identification of other structures is encouraged but is not necessary to meet this
						requirement.</p>

					<h4>Identifying escapable structures</h4>

					<p>Some content elements are containers for expressing complex information. A table, for example,
						has data arranged in rows and cells. Lists similarly can contain many items. While users might
						be interested in some of the information in these structures, they also often want to escape
						from them to keep reading, not have to listen to the entire content before being able to move
						on. These are called escapable elements, because the user needs to be able to escape from them
						whenever they choose to simplify the reading experience.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a data-cite="epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a> [[epub]] only
						supports escapability if structural semantics are added to the markup using the <a

							<a data-cite="epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"><code>seq</code></a> and <a

						are what allow <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> to provide users
						the option to escape their playback sequences.</p>

					<p>It is strongly advised to identify the following structures for escapability:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Figures &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#figure"><code>figure</code> semantic</a>

					<h4>Synchronizing the navigation document</h4>

					<p>A <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">media overlay document</a> can be provided for
						the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation document</a> even when the
						navigation document is not included in the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-spine">spine</a>. Doing
						so allow <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> to announce the link
						labels regardless of how they present the navigation elements to users (e.g., many reading
						systems applications create custom table of contents panels by extracting the data from the EPUB
						navigation document).</p>

					<p>The process for adding a media overlay document is no different than one for any other
						document.</p>

				<h3>Do not restrict access through digital rights management</h3>

				<p><a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> typically require preservation of the
					publisher's and author's intellectual property when distributed (e.g., so that they can be made
					available for individual sale through online bookstores or distributed through library systems). The
					most common way to address this need has been through the application of digital rights management
					(DRM) schemes to the packaged EPUB publication. DRM enables a variety of security features that
					aren't native to the EPUB format, such as the ability to limit access to a single user and to limit
					the length of time the person can access the publication (e.g., library loans).</p>

				<p>In general, DRM can be made to work interoperably with <a
						data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a>, but problems arise
					when DRM restrictions remove direct access to an EPUB publication or restrict access to the content
					within it. Unless the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> implementing
					the DRM provides API level access to the content, it can prove difficult, or even impossible, to
					generate text-to-speech playback, or for a refreshable braille display to have access to the
					underlying text, as well as cause other accessibility issues.</p>

				<p>Therefore, the application of digital rights management cannot impair or impede the functionality of
					assistive technologies on EPUB publications users have the right to access.</p>

				<h3>Include accessibility metadata in distribution records</h3>

				<p>When an <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> is ingested into a
					distribution system, such as a bookstore or library, a metadata record is often provided separately
					to the distributor. In these scenarios, the metadata used to enable discovery of the publication
					typically comes from the distribution record alone, not from the metadata in the package
					document.</p>

				<p>The result is that it is necessary to include as much accessibility metadata in distribution records
					as their vocabularies allow.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The use of distribution records does not remove the requirement to include accessibility metadata
						in the <a data-cite="epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a>. The metadata in the
						package document ensures accessibility information is always available with the publication.</p>
				</div>

				<aside class="example" title="ONIX accessibility metadata">
					<p>In this example, the ONIX record includes accessibility metadata that states that the EPUB
						publication has no accessibility features disabled (10), includes a table of contents (11) and
						has a correct reading order (13).</p>
