			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>This document provides answers to commonly asked questions about the <a
					href="http://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y/">EPUB Accessibility</a> specification and its <a
					href="http://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech">associated techniques</a>. It provides guidance and
				insight into how the document was created and the reasons for various choices in implementation.</p>

			<p>The document is not intended as a how-to guide to creating accessible content. Please use the <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/issues">W3C Publishing Community Group issue tracker</a> to
				ask questions about how to implement the requirements of the EPUB Accessibility specification.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-general">
			<h2>General</h2>

			<section id="sec-general-epub-version">
				<h3>What version of EPUB does this specification apply to?</h3>

				<p>Although the EPUB Accessibility specification was developed primarily for EPUB 3, it is designed to
					be applicable to earlier versions of the format. The requirements and techniques can be applied to
					make both EPUB 3-conformant and EPUB 2-conformant publications accessible.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-disc">
			<h2>Discovery Metadata</h2>

			<section id="sec-disc-schema">
				<h3>Why was schema.org metadata chosen?</h3>

				<p><a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a> metadata is required in the package document because it
					provides a comprehensive set of descriptive metadata that fits the EPUB metadata model.</p>

				<p>As EPUB continues to integrate with the Open Web Platform — where schema.org metadata is used by the
					major search engines when cataloguing information — it also represents a stable fit for future
					versions of the standard.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-disc-onix">
				<h3>Why is ONIX not required for discovery metadata?</h3>

				<p>Although ONIX is critical metadata in ebook distribution channels, EPUB publications are not
					necessarily books nor are they all distributed through the major ebook channels. Requiring all
					authors of EPUB content to include an ONIX record would complicate production, potentially turning
					authors off from including accessibility metadata. It would also require authoring tools to be able
					to create and modify ONIX records, and Reading Systems to parse the records to retrieve the
					information. To minimize this impact on the existing ecosystem, and ensure that the metadata is
					always available in an easily retrievable fashion, schema.org metadata was chosen.</p>

				<p>The choice of schema.org metadata in the package document does not diminish the need for rich
					accessibility metadata in ONIX records, and there is a requirement to include accessibility metadata
					in any distribution records that accompany an EPUB publication.</p>

				<p>The accessibility group is looking to work with the various metadata authorities to harmonize their
					accessibility vocabularies as a future objective so that the same information can be encoded across
					formats.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-disc-publicize">
				<h3>Can I call my discoverable publication accessible?</h3>

				<p>If your publication only includes discoverability metadata (i.e., it does not meet the accessibility
					requirements and is not an optimization), it must not be promoted as accessible per this
					specification.</p>

				<p>Meeting the discovery requirements allows users to determine whether the content will be usable by
					them, but is not in itself an achievement that they need to be made aware of.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-a11y">
			<h2>Accessibility Conformance</h2>

			<section id="sec-a11y-meeting">
				<h3>What if I cannot meet all these requirements?</h3>

				<p>Changing production practices is never easy, but there also needs to be a clear benchmark to meet to
					begin making progress. The EPUB 3 Working Group understands that the ability to meet these
					requirements is going to vary depending on the nature of the content produced and how it is
					produced.</p>

				<p>The Working Group has also structured the specification to soften the move as much as possible,
					without compromising the usability of the content. The specification only requires WCAG 2.0 Level A
					conformance, for example, even though many regulatory frameworks require Level AA conformance for
					web content (publishers already have to meet the higher level in such jurisdictions). Conformance is
					also not mandatory for an EPUB publication to be valid, so that accessibility does not become a
					barrier to distribution while publishers are improving their processes.</p>

				<p>The Working Group could not lower the threshold below WCAG conformance, as trying to pick and choose
					rules to follow would lead to content that is only accessible to certain audiences, and certifying
					who those audiences are would be a complex undertaking.</p>

				<p>The issue with raising production quality is why the discovery metadata is so important to include. A
					publisher may not be able to state their content fully conforms to the specification, but if the
					work that has been done can be surfaced then users can make the decision for themselves about
					whether it will still meet their needs.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-a11y-wcag-ext">
				<h3>Is this specification an extension of WCAG?</h3>

				<p>No, it leverages <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG">WCAG</a> and includes additional requirements,
					but is not an official extension and should not be referred to as one.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-a11y-wcag-coop">
				<h3>Why not include the EPUB requirements in WCAG?</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3 Working Group and Web Accessibility Initiative do calloborate to integrate requirements in
					WCAG 2 when possible. It is anticipated that greater integration of EPUB and web accessibility
					requirements will occur in a future WCAG 3.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-a11y-partial">
				<h3>Why are there guidelines for only some HTML elements in the techniques?</h3>

				<p>The techniques document does not duplicate the general web acccessibility techniques already defined
					by WCAG 2. It only addresses situations where the guidance differs for publications, or where no
					guidance exists.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-a11y-alternatives">
				<h3>What if there is another way to make content accessible that is not listed?</h3>

				<p>The techniques documents for both the EPUB Accessibility specification and WCAG 2 are advisory in
					nature. New techniques are always being developed to handle new situations. If a new technique
					provides the same level of accessibility, it is acceptable to use it.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-a11y-checklist">
				<h3>Is there a checklist of requirements?</h3>

				<p>The techniques do not include a checklist, as the requirement for conformance will vary from
					publication to publication (e.g., depending on the type of content included).</p>

				<p>The <a href="https://daisy.github.io/ace/">Ace by DAISY</a> validator is now available for
					machine-checking the accessibility of publications. It is accompanied by the <a
						href="https://smart.daisy.org/">Ace SMART</a> tool that guides human testing and verification of
					WCAG conformance.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-a11y-url">
				<h3>Why was the conformance metadata changed in version 1.1?</h3>

				<p>In verison 1.0 of the specification, the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y/#sec-conf-reporting">dcterms:conformsTo property</a> used
					a URL for the old International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) as the identifier for
					conformance.</p>

				<p>With the IDPF having merged into W3C, it longer made sense to use a URL for the old organization. To
					avoid the problem of organization-specific URLs occurring again in the future, the group decided to
					create new identifiers that focus solely on the specification and conformance to it.</p>

				<p>The new identifiers are equally as unique as the old URLs, so conformance statements are consistent
					across publications and can still be easily checked by machine (e.g., for validation, ingestion into
					a distribution system, etc.).</p>

				<p>A human-readable statement about conformance should be included in the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/#sec-meta-005">schema:accessibilitySummary
						property</a>. The EPUB Accessibility specification does not require wording for such
					statements.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-opt">
			<h2>Optimized Publications</h2>

			<section id="sec-opt-identify-why">
				<h3>Why identify optimizations?</h3>

				<p>The identification of optimizations ties into the importance of discovery metadata. Content that
					meets accessibility requirements for specific user groups needs to be discoverable by those groups,
					even if the content is not considered broadly accessible (e.g., braille- and audio-optimized
					publications).</p>

				<p>Identifying the third-party standard the content conforms to gives users this missing context.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-opt-identify-how">
				<h3>How do I identify an optimization standard?</h3>

				<p>Conformance to a third-party standard is indicated by including a link tag in the metadata with a URL
					that points to where the standard is defined.</p>

				<aside class="example">
					<p>The following example indicates that the publication conforms to DAISY guidelines for navigable
						audio-only publications.</p>

					<pre>&lt;link
   rel="a11y:conformsTo"
   href="http://www.daisy.org/guidelines/epub/navigable-audio-only-epub3-guidelines"/></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>It is recommended to include a human-readable description of conformance in the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/#sec-meta-005">schema:accessibilitySummary
						property</a>, as well.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-opt-publicize">
				<h3>Can I call my optimized publication accessible?</h3>

				<p>The EPUB Accessibility specification does not endorse optimizations; it only address how to identify
					them in the metadata.</p>

				<p>Any claims about the accessibility of an optimization must not make reference to the EPUB
					Accessibility specification. Such a claim should identify the standard the publication conforms to
					and the organization that created that standard.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-opt-registry">
				<h3>What is the optimized standards guide?</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3 Working Group maintains a <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/wiki/Guide-to-Optimized-Publication-Standards">guide of
						known optimization standards</a> to help facilitate lookup of their identifiers.</p>
