			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>This document, EPUB Accessibility Techniques, provides informative guidance on how to understand and
					apply the discovery and accessibility requirements defined in the EPUB Accessibility 1.1
					specification [[epub-a11y-11]] that are unique to <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>.</p>

				<p>This document does not cover general web accessibility techniques already addressed in [[wcag2]] and
					[[wai-aria]], for example, for which no substantive differences in application exist. Following
					those techniques, as applicable, is also essential to meeting the accessibility requirements of the
					EPUB Accessibility 1.1 specification.</p>

				<p>This document is not intended to be read in isolation, in other words, as it does not define
					conformance requirements for making accessibility claims or cover every method for producing
					accessible content. An EPUB publication must meet all the requirements of EPUB Accessibility 1.1 to
					make a claim of accessibility. Verifying only the techniques in this document does not mean an <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creator</a> can claim conformance to
					EPUB Accessibility 1.1.</p>

				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This document uses terminology defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-terminology">EPUB
						3.3</a> [[epub-3]] and <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#sec-terminology">EPUB Accessibility 1.1</a>

			<h2>About the techniques</h2>

			<p>The accessibility techniques described in this document are advisory in nature. They are intended to help
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> create <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> that conform to the
				requirements in [[epub-a11y-11]], but they are not all applicable in all situations and there may be
				other ways to meet the requirements of that specification. As a result, this document should not be read
				as providing prescriptive requirements.</p>

			<p>These techniques also do not address issues in digital publishing for which no universally accessible
				solutions exist. The W3C's Digital Publishing Interest Group has published a note that outlines many of
				these issues [[dpub-accessibility]]. As solutions become available, they will be incorporated into the
				appropriate document, whether this one or one it refers to.</p>

			<p>If EPUB creators encounter issues that are not covered in these or related techniques, they are
				encouraged to report the issue to the appropriate community for guidance on how to meet accessibility
				standards. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/">W3C Web Accessibility Interest Group</a> has a
				public mailing list where issues meeting [[wcag2]] and [[wai-aria]] requirements can be raised. The <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/issues">W3C Publishing Community Group issue tracker</a> can
				be used to ask for support implementing EPUB-specific requirements and the <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues">EPUB 3 Working Group's issue tracker</a> to report
				issues with this document.</p>

			<h2>Discovery metadata techniques</h2>

			<section id="meta-001">
				<h3>Identify primary access modes</h3>

				<p>An access mode is defined as a "human sense perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a
					user may process or perceive the content of a digital resource." [[iso24751-3]] For example, if an
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> contains images
					and video, visual perception is required to consume the content exactly as it was created.</p>

				<p>There are four access modes that are typically specified for EPUB publications:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>textual</strong> — the publication contains text content (headings, paragraphs,
							etc.).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>visual</strong> — the publication contains visual content such as images, graphics,
							diagrams, animations, and video.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>auditory</strong> — the publication contains auditory content such as standalone
							audio clips and audio soundtracks for video content.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>tactile</strong> — the publication contains tactile content such as embedded braille
							and tactile diagrams.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For a user to determine whether an EPUB publication is suitable for their needs, they need to know
					which of these access modes are required to consume the content. List all applicable access modes in
					the [[schema-org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessMode"><code>accessMode</code> property</a>,
					repeating the property for each applicable mode.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata entries for textual and visual access modes">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p><strong>Do not</strong> list access modes for content that does not contain information necessary to
					understand a publication. Most EPUB publications contain cover images, for example, but it is not
					necessary to see the cover image to read the publication. The same is true of publisher logos and
					images in the content are only for presentational purposes (i.e., have no information so have empty
					[[html]] <code>alt</code> attribute values). If these are the only visual content, then it is not
					valid to list a visual access mode. Similarly, if the only audio an EPUB publication contains is
					background music (e.g., for an instructional video with text captions, or as mood music while
					reading), listing an auditory access mode is not valid.</p>

				<p>Note that the access modes of the content do not reflect any adaptations that have been provided. For
					example, if a comic book also includes alternative text for each image, it does not have a textual
					access mode. See the following section on <a href="#meta-002">sufficient access modes</a> for how to
					indicate that the available adaptations allow the content to be consumed in another mode.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessMode">The
							<code>accessMode</code> Property</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] for more information about this
					property and its values.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-002">
				<h3>Identify sufficient access modes</h3>

				<p>The access modes sufficient to consume an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication"
						>EPUB publication</a> express a broader picture of the potential usability than do the <a
						href="#meta-001">basic access modes</a>. Where the basic access modes identify the default
					nature of the media used in the publication, sufficient access modes identify all the individual
					modes, and sets of modes, that allow a user to read a publication. Sufficient access modes account
					for the affordances and adaptations that the EPUB creators have provided, allowing users to
					determine whether they can the read content regardless of its default nature.</p>

				<p>Sufficient access modes are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"><code>accessModeSufficient</code> property</a>.
					Repeat the property for each set of sufficient access modes.</p>

				<p>The most strongly recommended sufficient access modes to list are the ones that consist of only a
					single value. Users seeking alternatives to the default encoding of the information typically want
					to read the content without switching reading modes (e.g., they want a purely textual alternative to
					use text-to-speech playback or an auditory alternative to listen to prerecorded narration). Listing
					the single value sets allows users to easily determine whether a publication will meet their reading
					needs.</p>

				<p>The most common single sufficient access modes for EPUB publications are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>textual</code> &#8212; setting this value indicates that the publication is screen-reader
						friendly (i.e., all the content is available for text-to-speech rendering by an assistive
						technology). EPUB creators can set this value for EPUB publications that conform to [[WCAG2]] <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc1">Level A</a> or higher, for example, as there must be
						textual alternatives for non-text content to meet these thresholds.</li>
					<li><code>auditory</code> &#8212; setting this value indicates that pre-recorded audio is available
						for the publication. EPUB creators can set this value for EPUB publications that provide media
						overlays for all the content.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>As an example of setting sufficient access modes, consider an EPUB publication that contains graphics
					and charts, as well as descriptions for all these images. The publication has both textual and
					visual content, so the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creator</a> will
					include the following <code>schema:accessMode</code> metadata entries to indicate this:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>This metadata does not make clear whether a textual access mode is sufficient to read the entire
					publication, or whether a visual one is, only that the user requires the ability to read in those
					two modes by default. This discrepancy is why sufficiency is also important to know.</p>

				<p>Since the EPUB creator has also included textual alternatives and/or descriptions for all the images
					in the example publication, the metadata can also indicate that a purely textual access mode is
					sufficient to read the content:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>Without this metadata, users would not have known that they could read the publication only via its
					textual content.</p>

				<p>It is important to emphasize when listing individual values in the
						<code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code> property not to simply restate each individual access
					mode. When adding a <code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code> property with only a single value,
						<strong>all information</strong> in the publication must be available in that mode.</p>

				<p>For example, the EPUB creator would not declare a sufficient access mode of "<code>visual</code>" for
					the example publication as the information is not entirely available in image-based form. (Photo
					books without text would be examples of works with a purely visual sufficient access mode.)</p>

				<p>EPUB creators may also list any sets of sufficient access modes that allow full access to the
					information. As the most typical set of values is the combination of all the access modes, however,
					the information this provides users is less helpful in determining the usability of a
					publication.</p>

				<p>For example, the metadata the EPUB creator inputs for the example publication re-establishes that
					there is a textual and visual reading option:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual,visual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The order in which EPUB creators list the access modes in a set is not important. The only
						requirement is to separate the values by commas.</p>
				</div>


				<p>The complete set of <code>schema:accessMode</code> and <code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code>
					entries for the example publication is as follows:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual,visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>Note that sufficiency of access is often a subjective determination of the EPUB creator based on
					their understanding of what information is essential to comprehending the text. Some information
					loss occurs by not being able to view a video, for example, but the EPUB creator might regard the
					visual or auditory losses as inconsequential if a transcript provides all the necessary information
					to understand the concepts being conveyed.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessModeSufficient">The
							<code>accessModeSufficient</code> Property</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] for more information
					about this property and its values.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The <code>accessModeSufficient</code> property, as defined in [[schema-org]], allows more
						complicated expressions than can be represented in the EPUB 2 or 3 <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> (e.g.,
						definition of lists of values and inclusion of a human-readable description). A future version
						of EPUB might allow for richer metadata, but the basic expression shown in this section is
						sufficient for discovery purposes.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-access-modes-sync-audio">
				<h3>Setting access modes for synchronized text-audio</h3>

				<p>Setting the correct access modes and sufficient access modes for EPUB 3 publications that contain
					synchronized text-audio playback requires evaluating whether playback is essential to reading the
					publication or an additional feature.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays</a> [[EPUB-3]]
					allows EPUB creators to synchronize the full text of a publication with full audio narration. These
					types of publications are commonly referred to as "read aloud" books, as the user chooses whether or
					not to turn on the narration (unlike traditional audiobooks where only the audio is available).</p>

				<p>In this case, because the audio playback is an extra feature, EPUB creators would
						<strong>not</strong> list "<code>auditory</code>" as an <a href="#meta-001">access mode</a>.
					Rather, they would indicate the presence of text and audio synchronization as an <a href="#meta-003"
						>accessibility feature</a>:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityFeature">
   synchronizedAudioText
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>Although the audio is not essential to reading the publication, having full audio playback capability
					means that there is an auditory <a href="#meta-002">sufficient access mode</a> &#8212; the user can
					listen to the complete publication. Consequently, the EPUB creator would declare a
						<code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code> property with the value <code>auditory</code>:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   auditory
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<div class="note">
					<p>When media overlays are present, EPUB creators should not add "<code>auditory</code>" to all the
						possible sufficient access modes just because it is possible to turn on text-audio playback.</p>

					<p>For example, a publication with media overlays that has text and images (with text alternatives)
						would only declare the following sufficient access modes: "<code>textual</code>",
							"<code>auditory</code>, and "<code>textual,visual</code>".</p>

					<p>It would <strong>not</strong> declare "<code>textual,auditory</code>" or
							"<code>textual,visual,auditory</code>".</p>
				</div>

				<p>Another use for media overlays &#8212; more typical among accessible republishers such as libraries
					that serve blind and low vision readers &#8212; is to provide full audio synchronized to the major
					headings of a publication. These types of publications are more like traditional audiobooks, as all
					the information in the work is typically available in auditory form. The minimal text does not allow
					meaningful visual reading or text-to-speech playback; it is only to provide structured navigation
					capabilities.</p>

				<p>In this case, being able to hear the audio is essential to being able to read the publication, so
					EPUB creators will list an auditory access mode:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   auditory
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>In a reverse of the first case discussed, EPUB creators will <strong>not</strong> identify text-audio
					synchronization as a feature of the publication since the amount of text provided is trivial.</p>

				<p>Likewise, since the text in the publication only provides heading navigation, EPUB creators will
						<strong>not</strong> list a textual access mode. The user does not need to, and is not expected
					to, visually read this text.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Some publications that provide the body in auditory form may include the backmatter in text form,
						allowing users to use text-to-speech playback to render it. In this case, there would be a
						textual component.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-003">
				<h3>Identify accessibility features</h3>

				<p>Identifying all the accessibility features and adaptations included in an <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> allows users to
					determine whether the content is usable at a more fine-grained level than the access modes do.</p>

				<p>For example, a math textbook might have a textual access mode, but that alone does not indicate
					whether MathML markup is available. Whether a visual work only provides alternative text or whether
					it includes extended descriptions is also important to know when gauging its usability.</p>

				<p>Accessibility features are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"><code>accessibilityFeature</code> property</a>.
					Repeat this property for each feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata entries for MathML and alternative text">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityFeature">
   MathML
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityFeature">
   alternativeText
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The EPUB format requires that some accessibility features will always be present (e.g., a table of
					contents). Do not exclude these features from the accessibility metadata, as users typically are not
					aware what features are built into a format. Failing to include entries will reduce the
					discoverability of the publication when users search for specific features.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityFeature">The
							<code>accessibilityFeature</code> Property</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] for more information
					about this property and its values.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-004">
				<h3>Identify accessibility hazards</h3>

				<p>There are three widely recognized hazards that can affect readers of digital content:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>flashing — if a resource flashes more than three times a second, it can cause seizures (e.g.,
							videos and animations). See also [[wcag2]] <a
								data-cite="wcag2#seizures-and-physical-reactions">Guideline 2.3</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>motion simulation — if a resource simulates motion, it can cause a user to become nauseated
							(e.g., a video game drawn on the [[html]] <a data-lt="canvas"
								><code>canvas</code> element</a> or parallax scrolling with CSS).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>sound — certain sound patterns, such as ringing and buzzing, can cause seizures, while loud
							or sudden changes in volume can also negatively affect users.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> have to report whether their
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> contain
					resources that present any of these hazards to users, as they can have real physical effects.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>What precisely constitutes a sound hazard, and how to test for these hazards, is not standardized
						as of publication of this document. EPUB creators will have to use their discretion on when to
						specify a sound hazard until additional guidance is developed. This technique will be updated
						whenever there is more clarity on this issue.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Hazards are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"
							><code>accessibilityHazard</code> property</a>. Repeat this property for each hazard.</p>

				<p>Unlike other accessibility properties, the presence of hazards can be expressed both positively and
					negatively. This design decision was made because users most often search for content that is free
					from hazards that affect them, but also want to know what dangers are present in any publications
					they discover.</p>

				<aside class="example"
					title="Metadata entries for a flashing hazard but no motion simulation or sound hazards">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   flashing
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   noMotionSimulationHazard
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   noSoundHazard
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Do not skip reporting hazards just because an EPUB publication does not contain any content that
					could present risks. Users cannot infer a meaning when no metadata is present. The value
						"<code>none</code>" can be used in such cases instead of repeating each non-hazard.</p>

				<p>If an EPUB publication contains a hazard, provide additional information about its source and nature
					in the <a href="#meta-005">accessibility summary</a>.</p>

				<p>If hazards cannot be definitively determined, report the value "<code>unknown</code>".</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityHazard">The
							<code>accessibilityHazard</code> Property</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] for more information
					about this property and its values.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-005">
				<h3>Include an accessibility summary</h3>

				<p>An accessibility summary provides a brief, human-readable description of the accessibility
					characteristics of an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
						publication</a> that cannot be expressed through the other discovery metadata.</p>

				<p>The accessibility summary should not simply repeat the conformance information provided in the
						<code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> property, for example, or the features listed in the
						<code>schema:accessibilityFeature</code> properties. When other accessibility metadata is
					present in the package document, systems that process EPUB publications can already present it to
					users. Repeating it in the summary only makes them hear the information again.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Accessibility summary that complements the conformance statement">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="dcterms:conformsTo">
   EPUB Accessibility 1.1 - WCAG 2.1 Level AA
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
   In addition to the requirements of its conformance claim,
   this publication includes sign language interpretation
   for all audio content.&#8230;
&lt;/meta>
					</pre>
				</aside>

				<p>EPUB creators should not include an accessibility summary when they have nothing more to add to the
					conformance claim and other discovery metadata.</p>

				<p>If an EPUB publication does not meet the requirements for content accessibility in [[epub-a11y-11]],
					the reason(s) it fails should be noted in the summary. Similarly, if an EPUB creator is hesitant to
					make a formal claim of conformance, the reasons why can be explained in the summary.</p>

				<p>An accessibility summary is provided using the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary"
					><code>accessibilitySummary</code> property</a>.</p>

				<aside class="example"
					title="Accessibility summary for a publication that fails the content accessibility requirements">
					<pre>&lt;meta

			<h2>WCAG techniques</h2>

				<h3>General guidance</h3>

				<p>Techniques for meeting the requirements of the [[wcag2]] are defined in <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/">Techniques for WCAG</a>. This document does not
					repeat those techniques.</p>

				<p>In general, the differences between the application of WCAG techniques to web pages and their
					application to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
						documents</a> is minimal, but the following sections outline some key differences.</p>

				<p>One point to note is that the WCAG techniques cover a greater range of technologies and content types
					than are typically found in an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
						publication</a>, so many are not applicable.</p>

				<p>The following sets of techniques are the most applicable to EPUB content documents:</p>

				</ul>

				<p>Other techniques will apply depending on the technologies used (e.g., a [[swf]] video in EPUB 2) or
					any alternative formats embedded in the EPUB publication (e.g., a PDF form).</p>

				<section id="sec-wcag-general-res">
					<h4>Helpful resources</h4>

					<p>EPUB creators not familiar with the [[wcag2]] may find the number of techniques daunting, as they
						are intended to provide broad coverage of possible solutions.</p>

					<p>Assistance applying these techniques to EPUB content documents is available from the following
						sources:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p><a href="https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/">DAISY Accessible Publishing Knowledge
									Base</a> — compendium of best practices by content type, with links to the
								applicable WCAG techniques.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><a href="https://bisg.org/store/viewproduct.aspx?id=13534677">BISG Quickstart Guide to
									Accessible Publishing</a> — includes a set of top practices for making content
								accessible.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-wcag-content-access">
				<h3>Content access</h3>

				<section id="access-001">
					<h4>Ensure meaningful order of content across spreads</h4>

					<p>[[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#meaningful-sequence">Success Criterion 1.3.2</a> specifies that
						each web page have a meaningful order (i.e., that the visual presentation of the content match
						the underlying markup).</p>

					<p>As EPUB allows two <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
							documents</a> to be rendered together in a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#spread"
							>synthetic spread</a> [[epub-3]], the order of content within a single document cannot
						always be evaluated in isolation. Content may span visually from one document to the next. For
						example, a sidebar might span the bottom of two pages.</p>

					<p>Ordering each document separately by the visual display will lead to users of <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> encountering
						gaps between the start and end of the spanned text. If the markup cannot be arranged to provide
						a more logical reading experience (e.g., the beginning of the spanned content at the end of the
						first page followed by the conclusion at the start of the next), another means of satisfying
						this criteria will be necessary to avoid failure (e.g., a hyperlink could be provided to allow a
						user to jump from the break point on the first page to the continuation on the next).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="access-002">
					<h4>Provide multiple ways to access the content</h4>

					<p>[[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#multiple-ways">Success Criterion 2.4.5</a> requires there be more
						than one way to locate a web page within a set of web pages. By default, <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> meet this WCAG
						requirement so long as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a>
						follow the EPUB requirements to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-spine-elem">include all
							EPUB content documents in the spine</a> and <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-itemref-elem">ensure access to all non-linear
							documents</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

					<p>The reason an EPUB publication passes by meeting these requirements has to do with differences in
						how a user interacts with the set of documents in an EPUB publication. In particular, although
						an EPUB publication typically consists of many <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>, <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> automatically
						provide the ability for the user to move seamlessly from one document to the next, so long as
						they are listed in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-spine-elem"
						>spine</a> [[epub-3]]. To the user, an EPUB publication is a single document they have complete
						access to, not a set of disconnected pages that they need links to move through.</p>

					<p>The required table of contents provides a second method to access the major headings of the
						publication. The user can jump to any heading and continue to navigate from there, regardless of
						how the publication is chunked.</p>

					<p>Following these two requirements therefore satisfies the need for multiple ways to access the
						content. Reading systems also typically provide search capabilities, something the EPUB creator
						cannot provide, so users also have a third option available in most cases.</p>

					<p>Although EPUB creators only need to follow EPUB requirements to meet this criterion, they are
						still encouraged to provide additional methods to improve access beyond the minimum. Some
						suggestions include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>adding at least one link to every EPUB content document in the spine to the table of
								contents, when feasible;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>adding an index to locate major topics; and</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>adding additional navigation aids to the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation
									document</a> (e.g., lists of figures and tables).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<section id="sec-access-002-toc">
						<h5>Note about the table of contents</h5>

						<p>A common question about the EPUB table of contents is what completeness it needs to have with
							respect to the headings of the publication. Although the obvious answer seems like it should
							be a simple aggregation of all headings for all sections, practically there are several
							usability challenges to this approach.</p>

						<p>Factors such as device screen sizes can make the table of contents for publications with a
							deep hierarchy of headings unreadable, so <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> will trim headings
							below a certain depth to improve the readability. Further, <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> do not
							always provide structured access to the headings in the table of contents, or provide
							shortcuts to navigate the links. The result is that users have to listen to each link one at
							a time to find where they want to go, a tedious and time-consuming process.</p>

						<p>Although it is expected that reading systems will improve access to the table of contents as
							accessibility support for EPUB evolves — making complete tables of contents usable by
							everyone — there are legitimate usability reasons why they are not provided now.</p>

						<p>When EPUB creators choose not to provide links to all the headings, however, they should
							optimize the linking they do provide for the best overall reading experience. Some
							considerations on how to achieve this include:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>ensuring that there is at least one link to every <a
										href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
										document</a> — allowing the user to reach each document simplifies navigation to
									the minor headings within them; and</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>only omitting minor headings from the table of contents — although a subjective
									decision, there is often a level of diminishing value for navigation (e.g., fourth
									level and lower headings often only delimit short subsections on a topic).</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section id="access-003">
					<h4>Ensure the order of table of contents entries matches linear order</h4>

					<p>The table of contents provides users more than just links into the content. It is also a means to
						understand the structure and ordering of an <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>. Consequently,
						users may have difficulty locating where they are in a publication, where they want to go, and
						also how to return to previous locations when the order of entries in the table of contents does
						not match the linear reading order.</p>

					<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> should therefore ensure
						that the entries in the table of contents always match the linear order of the content.
						Specifically, the order of entries should reflect both:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the order of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
								documents</a> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-spine">spine</a>;
							and</li>
						<li>the order of each referenced section within its respective EPUB content document.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Only if there is a logical case for an alternative arrangement of entries should the ordering
						differ. Such scenarios typically only occur when the content does not have to be read linearly
						or when additional information is included at the end of a table of contents. For example, the
						table of contents for a magazine might be ordered to list all the major articles first, followed
						by features, etc.</p>

					<p>When the ordering of the table of contents does not match the content, EPUB creators should
						include an explanation why in the <a href="#meta-005">accessibility summary</a>.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators should avoid including links to supplementary content at the end of the table of
						contents. Links to figure, tables, illustrations and similar content is better included as a
						separate navigation elements (either in the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation document</a>
						or in the spine). EPUB creators can include links to these additional navigation lists in the
						table of contents.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="access-bypass-blocks">
					<h4>Bypass blocks not necessary</h4>

					<p>Web sites are constructed very differently from EPUB publications. A typical web site wraps the
						content of each page within a repeating template, for example. This template gives each page a
						consistent look and feel, but users are rarely interested in the wrapper content after visiting
						the first page. Visual readers can typically skip past the site header, navigation bars, search
						boxes, and other helpful but seldom-used features to get right to the content.</p>

					<p>To provide the same ease of access to readers who would have to navigate sequentially through the
						repetitive content, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#bypass-blocks">success criterion
							2.4.1</a> [[wcag2]] requires a means of bypassing the repeated content in a set of pages.
						This success criterion does not apply to typical EPUB publications, however, as EPUB content
						documents do not repeat content in the same way that web sites do.</p>

					<p>Each new content document may begin with similar content, such as learning objectives or key
						terms, but this content is part of the body of the publication and not identical to what came
						before. Consequently, it is not required to add a link to skip it. (Secondary content should be
						identified in accordance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#info-and-relationships"
							>success criterion 1.3.1</a>, however.)</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>If an EPUB publication were to reproduce a set of web pages with their full site trappings,
							then success criterion 2.4.1 would apply, but this practice is not common.</p>
					</div>

			<section id="sec-wcag-roles">
				<h3>Roles</h3>

				<section id="sem-001">
					<h4>ARIA roles and <code>epub:type</code></h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The following guidance is only for <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>.
							The <code>type</code> attribute is the only means of adding structural information to <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">media overlay
								documents</a> so that features like lists and tables can be navigated more efficiently.
							It is also required in the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation
								document</a> to identify key structures.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Although the <code>role</code> attribute may seem similar in nature to the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"
						><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[epub-3]], their target uses in EPUB content documents do not
						overlap.</p>

					<p>The key difference between these attributes is that the <code>role</code> attribute bridges
						accessibility in content while the <code>type</code> attribute provides hooks to enable <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> behaviors.
						Omitting roles lessens the accessibility for users of <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a>, in other
						words, while omitting types diminishes certain functionality in <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> (e.g., pop-up
						footnotes or special presentations of the content).</p>

					<p>Since each attribute offers different advantages, it is not necessary that they be used together.
						Due to the lack of restrictions on where <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator"
							>EPUB creators</a> can use the <code>type</code> attribute, pairing the attributes may cause
						accessibility issues (e.g., putting roles on the [[html]] <a data-lt="body"><code>body</code>
							element</a>).</p>

					<p>In particular, the use of the <code>type</code> attribute is not a means of satisfying
						requirements for ARIA roles in WCAG.</p>

					<p>For EPUB creators looking to move from the <code>type</code> attribute to using ARIA roles, the
							<a href="https://idpf.github.io/epub-guides/epub-aria-authoring/">EPUB Type to ARIA Role
							Authoring Guide</a> guide details notable authoring differences between the two attributes.
						It also includes a mapping table of semantics in the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary to
						equivalent ARIA roles in [[dpub-aria-1.0]] and [[wai-aria]].</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sem-002">
					<h4>Do not repeat roles across chunked content</h4>

					<p>Although <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> appear
						as single contiguous documents to users when read, they are typically composed of many
						individual <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
							documents</a>. This practice keeps the amount of markup that has to be rendered small to
						reduce the load time in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
							systems</a> (i.e., to minimize the time the user has to wait for a document to appear). It
						is rare, at least for books, for an EPUB publication to contain only one EPUB content document
						with all the content in it.</p>

					<p>When content is chunked in this way, it often requires the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creator</a> to make decisions about
						how best to restructure the information. A part, for example, will typically not include all the
						chapters that belong to it. The EPUB creator will instead separate the part heading from each
						chapter, putting each into a separate document.</p>

					<p>Although visually these restructuring decisions can be hidden from readers, they impact the
						functionality of <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive
						technologies</a>. In the case of [[wai-aria]] roles, the result is that only the subset present
						in the currently-loaded EPUB content document are exposed to users. An assistive technology
						cannot provide a list of landmarks for the whole publication, as it cannot see outside the
						current document.</p>

					<p>To counteract this destructuring effect, EPUB creators sometimes think to re-add or re-identify
						structures in the belief that having this information in every document will be helpful to users
						(e.g., adding an extra [[html]] <a data-lt="section"><code>section</code> element</a> around a
						chapter to indicate it belongs to a part). All this practice does, however, is add repetition
						that is not only disruptive when reading but can make the structure of the publication harder to
						follow. EPUB creators are therefore advised not to attempt to rebuild structures in these
						ways.</p>

					<p>For example, consider a book that has five parts and each part contains five chapters.
						Structurally, each chapter belongs to its part (i.e., is grouped with it), as in the following
						markup:</p>

					<pre>&lt;html … >
   …
   &lt;body>
      &lt;section
          role="doc-part"
          aria-labelledby="p1">
         
         &lt;h1 id="p1">Part 1&lt;/h1>
         
         &lt;section
             role="doc-chapter"
             aria-labelledby="c1">
            
            &lt;h2 id="c1">Chapter 1&lt;/h2>
            …
         &lt;/section>
         …
      &lt;/section>
      …
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

					<div class="note">
						<p>When more than one instance of a role is included in a document, each must be uniquely
							identified. The <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute provides the name of each landmark in
							the preceding example. The attribute is not required if only one instance is present, so it
							is omitted from the following examples.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Since this would lead to a large content file, the part heading is typically split out into its
						own EPUB content document so that it will appear on its own page:</p>

					<pre>&lt;html … >
   …
   &lt;body>
      &lt;section 
          role="doc-part">
         &lt;h1 id="p1">Part 1&lt;/h1>
      &lt;/section>

					<h4>Include EPUB landmarks</h4>

					<p>[[wai-aria]] <a data-cite="wai-aria#dfn-landmark">landmarks</a> are similar in nature to <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-landmarks">EPUB landmarks</a> [[epub-3]]: both are
						designed to provide users with quick access to the major structures of a document, such as
						chapters, glossaries and indexes. ARIA landmarks are compiled automatically by <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> from the <a
							href="#sem-001">roles</a> that have been applied to the markup, so <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> only need to follow
						the requirement to include roles for the landmarks to be made available to users.</p>

					<p>Although automatic generation of ARIA landmarks simplifies authoring, it also means that ARIA
						landmarks are limited to how the EPUB publication has been chunked up into <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>. An
						assistive technology can only present the landmarks available in the currently-loaded document;
						it cannot provide a complete picture of all the landmarks in a multi-document publication (see
						the <a href="#sem-002">previous section</a> for more discussion about content chunking).</p>

					<p>EPUB landmarks, on the other hand, are compiled by the EPUB creator prior to distribution, and
						are not directly linked to the use of the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"
						><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[epub-3]] in the content. They are designed to simplify
						linking to major sections of the publication in a machine-readable way, as <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> do not scan
						the entire publication for landmarks, either. EPUB landmarks are typically not as numerous as
						ARIA landmarks, as reading systems only expose so many of these navigation aids.</p>

					<p>Given these differences in application, however, it is important to include EPUB landmarks and
						not rely only on the presence of ARIA roles to facilitate navigation, and vice versa. Each aids
						navigation in its own way.</p>

					<p>The EPUB specification does not require that EPUB creators include a specific set of landmarks,
						but it is recommended to include a link to the start of the body matter as well as to any major
						reference sections (e.g., table of contents, endnotes, bibliography, glossary, index).</p>

					<h4>Include publication and document titles</h4>

					<p>[[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#page-titled">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> requires that each web
						page include a title. EPUB has a similar requirement for <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>: publications
						require a [[dcterms]] <code>title</code> element in the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> metadata. The
						[[wcag2]] requirement is not satisfied by the EPUB requirement, however.</p>

					<p>When authoring an EPUB publication each <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content document</a> also
						requires a descriptive title that describes its content. If not provided, <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a> often will
						announce the name of the file to users.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Title for an EPUB content document">
						<pre>&lt;html …>
   &lt;head>
      &lt;title>Chapter 1&lt;/title>

					<h4>Ensure numbered headings reflect publication hierarchy</h4>

					<p>To a user, an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>
						appears as a single document that they read from beginning to end, even though the content is
						often split across numerous <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB
							content documents</a>. As a result, their natural expectation is that the headings reflect
						their position in the overall hierarchy of the publication, despite the publication not actually
						being a single document (e.g., if a part heading is expressed in an [[html]] <a data-lt="h1"
								><code>h1</code> element</a>, each chapter that belongs to the part will have an <a
							data-lt="h2"><code>h2</code></a> heading).</p>

					<p>Technique <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G141">G141: Organizing a page
							using headings</a> instructs <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB
							creators</a> on correctly using numbered headings within a document, but with EPUB
						publications the numbered headings also need to remain consistent across documents. Practically,
						this means that each EPUB content document does not have to begin with an
						<code>h1</code> heading unless the first heading is a top-level heading — the first heading
						needs to have a numbered heading element that reflects its actual position in the
						publication.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators also to need chunk their content so that the first heading in a document always has
						the highest number. For example, if a document starts with an <code>h3</code> heading, there
						should not be an <code>h2</code> heading later in the document (e.g., do not include the start
						of a new section with the trailing subsections of the previous). It is acceptable for there to
						be subsequent headings at the same level as the first (e.g., multiple subsections in one
						document could all have <code>h3</code> headings).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Heading order across documents">
						<p>In this example, there are two consecutive EPUB content documents in a textbook. The first
							contains the section heading (<code>h2</code>) and the first two subsections

					<h4>Heading topic or purpose</h4>

					<p>[[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#non-text-content">Success Criterion 2.4.6</a> currently states that
						all headings must describe their topic or purpose. The implication of this wording is that all
						chapters in a novel, for example, have a topic or purpose and that the topic or purpose is
						always clearly reflected by the title of the chapter. Not only is this not always the case, but
						this success criterion also complicates the use of chapter numbers as headings since these do
						not establish a topic.</p>

					<p>After discussion in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/2039">Accessibility
							Guidelines Working Group's issue tracker</a>, it is clear that the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels">understanding
							document for 2.4.6</a> captures the intent of the success criterion better than the current
						wording &#8212; namely, that the requirement for headings is only that they establish a unique
						context for the content.</p>

					<p>By this interpretation, the headings in publications should always pass provided they are
						unique.</p>

					<p>It is expected that the wording of the success criterion will be updated to better reflect the
						uniqueness requirement, likely in the future WCAG 3 due the complexities of changing the wording
						for WCAG 2.</p>

					<h4>Language of package document</h4>

					<p>[[wcag2]] Success Criterions <a data-cite="wcag2#language-of-page">3.1.1</a> and <a
							data-cite="wcag2#language-of-parts">3.1.2</a> deal with the language of a page and changes
						of language with in, respectively.</p>

					<p>For <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>, the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> is also an
						important source of metadata information about the publication. For example, <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> expose
						details of the publications to users in their bookshelves using this information.</p>

					<p>Consequently, it is necessary to provide the language of all text content in the package document
						to conform with these WCAG success criteria. The easiest way to meet this requirement is to add
						an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute on the root <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-package-elem"><code>package</code> element</a>
						[[epub-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="All text declared to be in Japanese by default">
						<pre><code>&lt;package … xml:lang="jp">
   …
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>If individual metadata fields within the package document are expressed in a different language,
						it is similarly required that the language change be identified by an <code>xml:lang</code>
						attribute on the element for the field.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Overriding the default language for a title">

					</aside>

					<p>Providing this information enables reading systems to correctly render the text content in the
						proper language for users.</p>

					<p class="note">The languages specified in the package document have no effect on individual EPUB
						content documents (i.e., the language of each document must be specified using the language
						expression mechanisms it provides).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="lang-002">
					<h4>Language of the EPUB publication</h4>

					<p>In addition to being able to express the language of text content, the <a

							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> to identify the

					<p>Although it is not strictly required to set this information to meet [[wcag2]] <a

						should be considered a best practice to always set this field with the proper language

					<p>Although <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> do not
						use this language information to render the text content of the EPUB publication, they do use it

				<h3>Text</h3>

				<section id="text-001">
					<h4>Use Unicode for text content</h4>

					<p>[[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#non-text-content">Success Criterion 1.1.1</a> requires that text
						equivalents be provided for all non-text content to meet Level A. In some regions (e.g., Asia),
						it is not uncommon to find images of individual text characters, despite the availability of
						Unicode character equivalents. This practice occurs for various reasons, such as ease of
						translation of older documents and for compatibility across <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a>. The use of
						images in most instances leads to the text not being accessible to non-visual users,
						however.</p>

					<p>When individual characters are replaced by images, there is invariably a negative effect on
						text-to-speech playback, even when alternative text is provided (e.g., if single characters
						within a word are replaced by images, the word will not be read as a single unit of text). It is
						also problematic for visual users, as the images often scale poorly and the characters cannot be
						changed to different font families to meet user preferences.</p>

					<p>The use of Unicode characters for all text content avoids this problem, allowing content to
						successfully meet the minimum requirement for Level A.</p>

					<p>For compliance with Level AA, EPUB creators are directed to <a data-cite="wcag2#images-of-text"
							>Success Criterion 1.4.5</a> which further restricts the use of images of text to only a set
						of essential cases.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-wcag-alt">
				<h3>Accessible alternatives</h3>

				<p>As <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> can be composed
					of more than one rendition, it is possible that different versions of the content will have
					different levels of accessibility. For example, an image-based version of the content that lacks
					alternative text or descriptions could be bundled with a WCAG-compliant text-based serialization.
					This type of accessible bundling is acceptable, as [[wcag2]] allows non-conforming content provided
					a <a data-cite="wcag2#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternate version</a> is
					available.</p>

				<p>The [[epub-multi-rend-11]] specification defines a set of features for creating these types of EPUB
					publications. It specifies a set of attributes that allow a <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> to automatically
					select a preferred rendition for the user or to provide the user the option to manually select
					between the available options. This functionality technically meets the requirements of [[wcag2]] in
					terms of ensuring the user can access the accessible version.</p>

				<p>In practice, however, the [[epub-multi-rend-11]] specification is not broadly supported in reading
					systems at the time of publication. As a result, a user who obtains an EPUB publication that
					contains more than one rendition will only have access to the default. Unless this rendition is the
					accessible one, the EPUB publication might not be readable by them.</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> therefore need to use their
					best discretion when implementing this functionality to meet accessibility requirements. EPUB
					publications that contain multiple renditions are conformant to the [[epub-a11y-11]] specification
					if at least one rendition meets all the content requirements, but EPUB creators at a minimum need to
					note that a reading system that supports multiple renditions is required in their <a
						href="#meta-005">accessibility summary</a>. Any other methods the EPUB creator can use to make
					this dependence known is advisable (e.g., in the <a href="#dist-002">distribution metadata</a>).</p>

				<p>This section will be updated with techniques for using multiple renditions when there is enough
					support in reading systems to broadly recommend their use.</p>

					<h4>Provide page break markers</h4>

					<p>Both the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary [[epub-ssv]] and Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA 1.0
						Module [[dpub-aria-1.0]] include a semantic for static page breaks: <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#pagebreak">pagebreak</a> and <a
							data-cite="dpub-aria-1.0#doc-pagebreak">doc-pagebreak</a>, respectively.</p>

					<p>It is recommended that both semantics be applied to EPUB 3 content to ensure maximum
						compatibility with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
							systems</a> and <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive
							technologies</a>.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expressing a page break">
						<p>In this example, the EPUB creator identifies an HTML <code>span</code> element as a page
							break.</p>
						<pre>&lt;span
    id="page001"
    epub:type="pagebreak"
    role="doc-pagebreak"
    aria-label="1"/></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>A <code>title</code> or <code>aria-label</code> attribute is required on the element, as it
						provides the value that is announced to the user. Do not include the page number as text
						content, as this practice forces the user to hear it announced wherever it occurs (e.g., without
						any context in the middle of a sentence).</p>

					<p>EPUB 2 does not include markup to identify static page break marks in the content. Page break
						destinations can be included to enable hyperlinking, but the <a href="#page-003">page
						list</a> is the only way a user can jump to the locations.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Adding a hyperlink destination">
						<p>In this example, the EPUB creator adds an XHTML 1.1 <code>span</code> element to use as a
							hyperlink destination.</p>
						<pre>&lt;html …>

      …
      &lt;span id="page001"/>

&lt;/html></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Do not use the [[html]] <a data-lt="a"><code>a</code> element</a> to identify page break
						locations in EPUB 3 publications. Although this element was previously defined as the anchor for
						a hyperlink destination, its purpose has been changed in [[html]] for use solely as a link.</p>

						in the audio playback of a publication it is not only distracting, but can be confusing, as well
						(e.g., the number could be read out in the middle of a sentence).</p>

					<p>To mitigate this potential annoyance to readers, <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> need to identify page
						announcements in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">media overlay
							documents</a> when they are included. Identification allows a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> to provide a
						playback experience where the numbers are automatically skipped.</p>

					<p>To identify page numbers in media overlay documents, attach an <code>epub:type</code> attribute
						with the value "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code></a>"
						[[epub-ssv]] to each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-par-elem"><code>par</code>
							element</a> [[epub-3]] that identifies a page number.</p>

					<h4>Identify the pagination source</h4>

					<p>Users typically want to know the source of the page break markers included in an <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> when they are
						derived from a static media. Considerations like which printing, by which publisher or imprint,
						and whether the pagination comes from the hard or soft cover edition will affect decisions about
						its usefulness (e.g., does it exactly match the pagination of a print book used in a
						classroom).</p>

					<p>To allow users to determine the suitability of the pagination, identify the ISBN of the source
						work in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a>
						metadata.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expressing the source of pagination">
						<p>In this example, the <code>dc:source</code> element contains the ISBN of the print source of
							pagination. This example is valid for both EPUB 2 and 3.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Adding a source-of declaration">
						<p>In this example, a <code>dc:source</code> element is explicitly identified as the source of

				<h3>Synchronized text-audio playback</h3>

				<section id="sync-001">
					<h4>Ensuring complete text coverage</h4>

					<p>Ensuring the complete text of an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publication</a> is synchronized with audio is key to allowing users who require full
						synchronized playback, or even audio-only playback, have access to the same information as users
						who do not require synchronized playback.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a>
						[[epub-3]] allows audio to be synchronized with any element in an <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content document</a>, so
						there is no technical barrier to providing synchronized playback.</p>

					<p>The primary consideration for this objective is what constitutes the text content of an EPUB
						publication. The minimal candidates for synchronization with audio are all the elements with
						visible text content.</p>

					<p>In HTML, the class of elements called [=palpable content=] [[html]] can typically be synchronized
						with audio or have their own built-in audio. Embedded text in SVG documents, on the other hand,
						is found in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#TextElement"><code>text</code>
							element</a> [[svg]] and its descendants.</p>

					<p>The media overlays <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-text-elem"><code>text</code>
							element</a> is used to reference these elements, either to play back the pre-recorded audio
						in a sibling <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-audio-elem"><code>audio</code>
							element</a> [[epub-3]] or to initiate playback of an audio or video element if the
							<code>audio</code> element is missing (e.g., for embedded audio and video in the
						document).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> should not
							synchronize hidden text content in an alternative presentation like media overlays.
							Synchronizing audio with invisible text will be confusing for sighted readers following the
							playback.</p>

						<p>Text content in a collapsed element, like the <a data-lt="details"><code>details</code>
								element</a> [[html]], is not considered hidden content.</p>
					</div>

					<p>In addition to synchronizing the visible text, synchronized text-audio playback must also address
						text alternatives for image-based content. Images may have alternative text and descriptions
						that are not visible to all users. As synchronization is also meant to aid users who cannot see
						the images, including these text alternatives and descriptions in the playback is essential to
						providing the user all the information in the EPUB publication.</p>

					<p>Text alternatives and descriptions in HTML may be represented in the <a
							data-cite="html#attr-img-alt"><code>alt</code> attribute</a> [[html]] and linked by ARIA
						attributes (e.g., <a data-cite="wai-aria#aria-describedby"><code>aria-describedby</code></a> and
							<a data-cite="wai-aria#aria-details"><code>aria-details</code></a> [[wai-aria]]).
						Descriptions for image elements in SVG are typically represented in a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#DescElement"><code>desc</code> element</a> but
						ARIA attributes may also be used.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sync-002">
					<h4>Specifying the reading order</h4>

					<p>The default reading order should typically represent the order in which <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> render
						content to users during synchronized text-audio playback. For <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>, this is a
						combination of the sequence of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document"
							>EPUB content documents</a> in the spine and the order of elements within each EPUB content
						document.</p>

					<p>If there are cases where the logical reading order (how a reader would naturally read the
						content) diverges from the default reading order, EPUB creators can order the playback sequence
						of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"><code>seq</code></a> and <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-par-elem"><code>par</code></a> elements in a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-overlay-docs">media overlays document</a> [[epub-3]]
						to match the logical order.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators need to use caution when making alterations, however, as other accessibility issues
						can arise when the logical order does not match the default order. For example, the content may
						not be accessible to users of <a data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive
							technologies</a> when the order in the markup does not match how the assistive technology
						reads the content. In these cases, using playback to create a logical order can make the EPUB
						publication fail WCAG conformance requirements.</p>

					<p>One case where the logical may diverge from the reading order and remain accessible is in tables,
						as assistive technologies typically allow users to choose whether to read by row or by
						column.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sync-003">
					<h4>Identifying skippable structures</h4>

					<p>Some content elements are not critical to read when following the primary narrative of a work,
						and that would interrupt a user's concentration if they had to stop and listen to. Footnotes and
						endnotes are examples of such content, as users may only want to come back and read this content
						after finishing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publication</a>. The announcement of page break numbers can be similarly annoying to
						readers.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a>
						[[epub-3]] does not allow <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
							systems</a> to determine if playback sequences are skippable unless <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> add additional
						semantics to the markup, however. EPUB creators must use the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"><code>epub:type</code></a>
						attribute [[epub-3]] to add semantics to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-seq-elem"
								><code>seq</code></a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-par-elem"
								><code>par</code></a> elements [[epub-3]], thereby allowing reading systems to provide
						users the option to skip their playback sequences.</p>

					<p>The recommended structures to identify for skippability are:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Endnotes &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#endnotes"><code>endnotes</code></a> and
								<a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#endnote"><code>endnote</code></a> semantics [[epub-ssv-11]]
							for groups of notes and individual endnotes, respectively.</li>
						<li>Footnotes &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#footnotes"><code>footnotes</code></a>
							and <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#footnote"><code>footnote</code></a> semantics [[epub-ssv-11]]
							for groups of footnotes and individual footnotes, respectively.</li>
						<li>Page breaks &#8212; use the <a data-cite="epub-ssv-11#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code>
								semantic</a> [[epub-ssv-11]] to identify each.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>EPUB creators may identify other structures but it is not necessary to meet this requirement.</p>

					<h4>Identifying escapable structures</h4>

					<p>Some content elements are containers for expressing complex information. A table, for example,

					<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> can add a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">media overlay document</a> for
						the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-navigation-document">EPUB navigation
							document</a> even when it is not included in the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-spine">spine</a>. Doing so allow <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> to announce
						the link labels regardless of how they present the navigation elements to users (e.g., many
						reading systems applications create custom table of contents panels by extracting the data from
						the EPUB navigation document).</p>

					<p>The process for adding a media overlay document is no different than one for any other
						document.</p>

				<h3>Do not restrict access through digital rights management</h3>

				<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> typically require
					preservation of the publisher's and author's intellectual property when distributed (e.g., so that
					they can be made available for individual sale through online bookstores or distributed through
					library systems). The most common way to address this need has been through the application of
					digital rights management (DRM) schemes to the packaged EPUB publication. DRM enables a variety of
					security features that aren't native to the EPUB format, such as the ability to limit access to a
					single user and to limit the length of time the person can access the publication (e.g., library
					loans).</p>

				<p>In general, DRM can be made to work interoperably with <a
						data-cite="epub-a11y-11#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a>, but problems arise
					when DRM restrictions remove direct access to an EPUB publication or restrict access to the content
					within it. Unless the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
						system</a> implementing the DRM provides API level access to the content, it can prove
					difficult, or even impossible, to generate text-to-speech playback, or for a refreshable braille
					display to have access to the underlying text, as well as cause other accessibility issues.</p>

				<p>The application of digital rights management therefore must not impair or impede the functionality of
					assistive technologies on EPUB publications users have the right to access.</p>

				<h3>Include accessibility metadata in distribution records</h3>

				<p>When an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> is ingested
					into a distribution system, such as a bookstore or library, a metadata record is often provided
					separately to the distributor. In these scenarios, the metadata used to enable discovery of the
					publication typically comes from the distribution record alone, not from the metadata in the package
					document.</p>

				<p>The result is that it is necessary to include as much accessibility metadata in distribution records
					as their vocabularies allow.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The use of distribution records does not remove the requirement to include accessibility metadata
						in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a>. The
						metadata in the package document ensures accessibility information is always available with the
						publication.</p>
				</div>

				<aside class="example" title="ONIX accessibility metadata">
					<p>In this example, the ONIX record includes accessibility metadata that states that the EPUB
						publication has no accessibility features disabled (10), includes a table of contents (11) and
						has a correct reading order (13).</p>

					>working group's issue tracker</a>.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>08-Sept-2022: Clarified that only meeting the techniques in this document is not sufficient for
					making claims of accessibility. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2407">issue
						2407</a></li>
				<li>12-Aug-2022: Clarified guidance that an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute on an
						<code>accessibilitySummary</code> property does not represent a translation. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pulls/2401">pull request 2401</a>.</li>
				<li>12-Aug-2022: Updated the <code>accessibilitySummary</code> explanation to avoid repeating
					information available in the other metadata. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2399">issue 2399</a>.</li>
				<li>20-July-2022: Added additional emphasis on setting single value access mode sufficient declarations
					and also listed and explained when to apply the two most common for EPUBs. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2302">issue 2302</a>.</li>
				<li>07-June-2022: Added a technique explaining how to set access modes and features when media overlays
					are present. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2303">issue 2303</a>.</li>
				<li>07-June-2022: Prioritized single-value <code>accessModeSufficient</code> declarations. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2302">issue 2302</a>.</li>
				<li>07-Apr-2022: Added techniques for addressing synchronized text-audio playback objectives using media
					overlays. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2221">issue 2221</a>.</li>
				<li>10-Nov-2021: Added techniques for setting language in the package document. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1842">issue 1842</a>.</li>
				<li>25-Oct-2021: Removed the generic technique labels for each section. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1866">issue 1866</a>.</li>
				<li>29-Sep-2021: Added <a href="#titles-003">new technique</a> to explain that headings only have to be
					unique, not define the topic or purpose of a section. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1810">issue 1810</a>.</li>
				<li>10-June-2021: Clarified the technique on meaningful sequence that it applies to content that spans
					pages in a spread and is not about ordering documents in the spine. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1695">issue 1695</a>.</li>
				<li>25-May-2021: Updated the section on ARIA roles to make clear that the <code>epub:type</code>
					attribute does not have to be used in coordination, nor that roles are required where
						<code>epub:type</code> is used.</li>
				<li>13-Apr-2021: Added an example of using the <code>source-of</code> property in EPUB 3 to identify
					which <code>dc:source</code> element is the source of pagination. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1600">issue 1600</a>.</li>
				<li>19-Feb-2021: References to WCAG 2.0 have been updated to undated references to WCAG 2 (except where
					WCAG 2.0 is explicitly mentioned for conformance).</li>
				<li>08-Jan-2021: Added technique recommending the <a href="#access-003">order of the table of
						contents</a> match the linear reading order of content. See <a

				<li>16-Nov-2020: The techniques for <a href="#meta-007">accessibility controls</a> and <a
						href="#meta-006">APIs</a> have been replaced with descriptions of why these properties are not
					necessary to set. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1286">issue 1286</a>.</li>
