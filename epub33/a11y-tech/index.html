				<h3>Purpose and Scope</h3>

				<p>This document, EPUB Accessibility Techniques, provides guidance on how to meet the
					[[EPUB-A11Y-11]] discovery and accessibility requirements for EPUB Publications.</p>

				<p>This document does not cover techniques and best practices already addressed in [[WCAG2]] and
					[[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] for which no substantive differences in application exist.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This document uses the following terminology defined in EPUB 3 [[EPUB-3]]:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB Content Document</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB Creator</a>

					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB Publication</a>
					</li>

				<p>In addition, it uses the definition of <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#dfn-assistive-technologies">assistive technology</a> as
					defined in [[WCAG2]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>An assistive technology is not always a separate application from a Reading System. Reading
						Systems often integrate features of standalone assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech
						playback.</p>

			<h2>About the Techniques</h2>

			<p>The accessibility techniques described in this document are advisory in nature. They are intended to help
				EPUB Creators create EPUB Publications that conform to the requirements in [[EPUB-A11Y-11]], but they
				are not all applicable in all situations and there may be other ways to meet the requirements of that
				specification. As a result, this document should not be read as providing prescriptive requirements.</p>

			<p>These techniques also do not address issues in digital publishing for which no universally accessible
				solutions exist. The W3C's Digital Publishing Interest Group has published a note that outlines many of
				these issues [[DPUB-Accessibility]]. As solutions become available, they will be incorporated into the
				appropriate document, whether this one or one it refers to.</p>

			<p>If EPUB Creators encounter issues that are not covered in these or related techniques, they are
				encouraged to report the issue to the appropriate community for guidance on how to meet accessibility
				standards. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/">W3C Web Accessibility Interest Group</a> has a
				public mailing list where issues meeting [[WCAG2]] and [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] requirements can be raised. The
					<a href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/issues">W3C Publishing Community Group issue
				tracker</a> can be used to ask for support implementing EPUB-specific requirements and the <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues">EPUB 3 Working Group's issue tracker</a> to report
				issues with this document.</p>

			<h2>Discovery Metadata Techniques</h2>

			<section id="meta-001">
				<h3>Identify primary access modes</h3>

				<p>An access mode is defined as a "human sense perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a
					user may process or perceive the content of a digital resource." [[ISO24751-3]] For example, if an
					EPUB Publication contains images and video, visual perception is required to consume the content
					exactly as it was created.</p>

				<p>There are four access modes that are typically specified for EPUB Publications:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>textual</strong> — the publication contains text content (headings, paragraphs,
							etc.).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>visual</strong> — the publication contains visual content such as images, graphics,
							diagrams, animations, and video.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>auditory</strong> — the publication contains auditory content such as standalone
							audio clips and audio soundtracks for video content.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>tactile</strong> — the publication contains tactile content such as embedded braille
							and tactile diagrams.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For a user to determine whether an EPUB Publication is suitable for their needs, they need to know
					which of these access modes are required to consume the content. List all applicable access modes in
					the [[schema-org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessMode"><code>accessMode</code> property</a>,
					repeating the property for each applicable mode.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata entries for textual and visual access modes">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Note that the access modes of the content do not reflect any adaptations that have been provided. For
					example, if a comic book also includes alternative text for each image, it does not have a textual
					access mode. See the following section on <a href="#meta-002">sufficient access modes</a> for how to
					indicate that the available adaptations allow the content to be consumed in another mode.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessMode">The
							<code>accessMode</code> Property</a> [[A11Y-DISCOV-VOCAB]] for more information about this
					property and its values.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-002">
				<h3>Identify sufficient access modes</h3>

				<p>The access modes sufficient to consume an EPUB Publication express a broader picture of the potential
					usability than do the <a href="#meta-001">basic access modes</a>. Where the basic access modes
					identify the default nature of the media used in the publication, sufficient access modes identify
					which modes, or sets of modes, a user requires to read the publication. Sufficient access modes
					account for the affordances and adaptations that have been provided, allowing a user to determine
					whether the content will be usable regardless of its default nature.</p>

				<p>Sufficient access modes are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"><code>accessModeSufficient</code> property</a>.
					Repeat the property for each set of sufficient access modes.</p>

				<p>For example, consider an EPUB Publication that contains graphics and charts, as well as descriptions
					for all these images. The publication has both textual and visual content, so the EPUB Creator will
					include the following metadata entries to indicate this:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>This metadata does not make clear whether a textual access mode is sufficient to read the entire
					publication, or whether a visual one is, only that two modes are required by default. This
					discrepancy is why sufficiency is also important to know.</p>

				<p>The first set of sufficiency metadata the EPUB Creator inputs will establish the textual and visual
					requirement:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual,visual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>The order in which the access modes are listed is not important. The only requirement is that they be
					separated by commas.</p>

				<p>Since the EPUB Creator has also included descriptions for all the images, the EPUB Creator can also
					indicate that a purely textual access mode is sufficient to read the content:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>Without this metadata, users would not have known that they could read the publication only via its
					text content.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A sufficient access mode of "<code>visual</code>" is not provided as the content is not entirely
						image-based. Textual content is considered a separate mode as it can be read both visually and
						aurally (text-to-speech). Photo books without text would be examples of works with a purely
						visual sufficient access mode.</p>
				</div>

				<p>The full set of entries in this example is as follows:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual,visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>Note that sufficiency of access is often a subjective determination of the EPUB Creator based on
					their understanding of what information is essential to comprehending the text. Some information
					loss occurs by not being able to view a video, for example, but the EPUB Creator might regard the
					visual or auditory losses as inconsequential if a transcript provides all the necessary information
					to understand the concepts being conveyed.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessModeSufficient">The
							<code>accessModeSufficient</code> Property</a> [[A11Y-DISCOV-VOCAB]] for more information
					about this property and its values.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The <code>accessModeSufficient</code> property, as defined in [[schema-org]], allows more
						complicated expressions than can be represented in the EPUB 2 or 3 Package Document (e.g.,
						definition of lists of values and inclusion of a human-readable description). A future version
						of EPUB might allow for richer metadata, but the basic expression shown in this section is
						sufficient for discovery purposes.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-003">
				<h3>Identify accessibility features</h3>

				<p>Identifying all the accessibility features and adaptations included in an EPUB Publication allows
					users to determine whether the content is usable at a more fine-grained level than the access modes
					do.</p>

				<p>For example, a math textbook might have a textual access mode, but that alone does not indicate
					whether MathML markup is available. Whether a visual work only provides alternative text or whether
					it includes extended descriptions is also important to know when gauging its usability.</p>

				<p>Accessibility features are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"><code>accessibilityFeature</code> property</a>.
					Repeat this property for each feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata entries for MathML and alternative text">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityFeature">
   MathML
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityFeature">
   alternativeText
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The EPUB format requires that some accessibility features will always be present (e.g., a table of
					contents). Do not exclude these features from the accessibility metadata, as users typically are not
					aware what features are built into a format. Failing to include entries will reduce the
					discoverability of the publication when users search for specific features.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityFeature">The
							<code>accessibilityFeature</code> Property</a> [[A11Y-DISCOV-VOCAB]] for more information
					about this property and its values.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-004">
				<h3>Identify accessibility hazards</h3>

				<p>There are three widely recognized hazards that can affect readers of digital content:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>flashing — if a resource flashes more than three times a second, it can cause seizures (e.g.,
							videos and animations). See also [[WCAG2]] <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#seizures-and-physical-reactions">Guideline
							2.3</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>motion simulation — if a resource simulates motion, it can cause a user to become nauseated
							(e.g., a video game drawn on the [[HTML]] <a data-cite="html#the-canvas-element"
									><code>canvas</code> element</a> or parallax scrolling with CSS).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>sound — certain sound patterns, such as ringing and buzzing, can cause seizures, while loud
							or sudden changes in volume can also negatively affect users.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>EPUB Creators have to report whether their EPUB Publications contain resources that present any of
					these hazards to users, as they can have real physical effects.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>What precisely constitutes a sound hazard, and how to test for these hazards, is not standardized
						as of publication of this document. EPUB Creators will have to use their discretion on when to
						specify a sound hazard until additional guidance is developed. This technique will be updated
						whenever there is more clarity on this issue.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Hazards are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"
							><code>accessibilityHazard</code> property</a>. Repeat this property for each hazard.</p>

				<p>Unlike other accessibility properties, the presence of hazards can be expressed both positively and
					negatively. This design decision was made because users most often search for content that is free
					from hazards that affect them, but also want to know what dangers are present in any publications
					they discover.</p>

				<aside class="example"
					title="Metadata entries for a flashing hazard but no motion simulation or sound hazards">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   flashing
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   noMotionSimulationHazard
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   noSoundHazard
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Do not skip reporting hazards just because an EPUB Publication does not contain any content that
					could present risks. Users cannot infer a meaning when no metadata is present. The value
						"<code>none</code>" can be used in such cases instead of repeating each non-hazard.</p>

				<p>If an EPUB Publication contains a hazard, provide additional information about its source and nature
					in the <a href="#meta-005">accessibility summary</a>.</p>

				<p>If hazards cannot be definitively determined, report the value "<code>unknown</code>".</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityHazard">The
							<code>accessibilityHazard</code> Property</a> [[A11Y-DISCOV-VOCAB]] for more information
					about this property and its values.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-005">
				<h3>Include an accessibility summary</h3>

				<p>An accessibility summary provides a brief, human-readable description of the accessibility
					characteristics of an EPUB Publication, or lack thereof.</p>

				<p>If an EPUB Publication does not meet the requirements for content accessibility in [[EPUB-A11Y-11]],
					the reason(s) it fails should be noted in the summary.</p>

				<p>An accessibility summary is provided using the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary"
					><code>accessibilitySummary</code> property</a>.</p>

				<aside class="example"
					title="Accessibility summary for a publication that fails the content accessibility requirements">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
   The publication is missing alternative text for complex diagrams.
   The publication otherwise meets WCAG 2.0 Level A.
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<aside class="example" title="Accessibility summary for a publication with a motion simulation hazard">
					<pre>&lt;meta3
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
   Chapter four contains a first-person interactive game that could cause
   motion sickness in certain individuals. The game is only provided for
   illustrative purposes, so readers unable to interact with it will not
   be at a disadvantage.
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Do not repeat this property unless it contains the summary in another language. In the case of
					multiple summaries, use the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute to differentiate the language.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilitySummary">The
							<code>accessibilitySummary</code> Property</a> [[A11Y-DISCOV-VOCAB]] for more information
					about this property.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-006">
				<h3>Identify ARIA Conformance</h3>

				<p>The use of the <code>schema:accesibilityAPI</code> property is no longer necessary for EPUB
					Publications. EPUB Creators are not responsible for the interaction between Reading Systems and the
					underlying platform APIs.</p>

				<p>Meeting the requirements of [[WCAG2]] is a better measure of the accessibility of scripting, as this
					property does not differentiate between ARIA markup used for document structure or for identifying
					controls.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="meta-007">
				<h3>Identify Input Control Methods</h3>

				<p>The use of the <code>schema:accesibilityControl</code> property is no longer necessary for EPUB
					Publications. This property does not differentiate issues arising from the Reading System interface
					from those in the underlying content, which has led to confusion about its use.</p>

				<p>Meeting the requirements of [[WCAG2]] will mitigate most known issues with the content and is
					sufficient for authoring purposes.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-meta-ex">
				<h3>Examples</h3>

				<p>The following examples show the metadata that would be added to an EPUB Publication that has textual
					and visual access modes, is sufficient for reading by text, contains alternative text and MathML
					markup, and has a flashing hazard.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="EPUB 3">
					<pre>&lt;package … >

						href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/">Techniques for WCAG</a>. This document does not
					repeat those techniques.</p>

				<p>In general, the differences between the application of WCAG techniques to Web pages and their
					application to EPUB Content Documents is minimal, but the following sections outline some key
					differences.</p>

				<p>One point to note is that the WCAG techniques cover a greater range of technologies and content types
					than are typically found in an EPUB Publication, so many are not applicable.</p>

				<p>The following sets of techniques are the most applicable to EPUB Content Documents:</p>

					any alternative formats embedded in the EPUB Publication (e.g., a PDF form).</p>

					<h4>Helpful Resources</h4>

					<p>EPUB Creators not familiar with the [[WCAG2]] may find the number of techniques daunting, as they
						are intended to provide broad coverage of possible solutions.</p>

					<p>Assistance applying these techniques to EPUB Content Documents is available from the following
						sources:</p>

				<h3>Content Access</h3>

				<section id="access-001">
					<h4>Ensure meaningful order of content across spreads</h4>

					<p>[[WCAG2]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#meaningful-sequence">Success Criterion 1.3.2</a>
						specifies that each Web page have a meaningful order (i.e., that the visual presentation of the
						content match the underlying markup).</p>

					<p>As EPUB allows two documents to be rendered together in a <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#spread">synthetic spread</a> [[EPUB-3]], the order of
						content within a single document cannot always be evaluated in isolation. Content may span
						visually from one document to the next. For example, a sidebar might span the bottom of two
						pages.</p>

					<p>Ordering each document separately by the visual display will lead to users of assistive
						technologies encountering gaps between the start and end of the spanned text. If the markup
						cannot be arranged to provide a more logical reading experience (e.g., the beginning of the
						spanned content at the end of the first page followed by the conclusion at the start of the
						next), another means of satisfying this criteria will be necessary to avoid failure (e.g., a
						hyperlink could be provided to allow a user to jump from the break point on the first page to
						the continuation on the next).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="access-002">
					<h4>Provide multiple ways to access the content</h4>

					<p>[[WCAG2]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#multiple-ways">Success Criterion
						2.4.5</a> requires there be more than one way to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages. By
						default, EPUB Publications meet this WCAG requirement so long as EPUB Creators follow the EPUB
						requirements to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-spine-elem">include all EPUB Content
							Documents in the spine</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-itemref-elem">ensure
							access to all non-linear documents</a> [[EPUB-3]].</p>

					<p>The reason an EPUB Publication passes by meeting these requirements has to do with differences in
						how a user interacts with the set of documents in an EPUB Publication. In particular, although
						an EPUB Publication typically consists of many Content Documents, Reading Systems automatically
						provide the ability for the user to move seamlessly from one document to the next, so long as
						they are listed in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-spine-elem"
						>spine</a> [[EPUB-3]]. To the user, an EPUB Publication is a single document they have complete
						access to, not a set of disconnected pages that they need links to move through.</p>

					<p>The required table of contents provides a second method to access the major headings of the
						publication. The user can jump to any heading and continue to navigate from there, regardless of
						how the publication is chunked.</p>

					<p>Following these two requirements therefore satisfies the need for multiple ways to access the
						content. Reading Systems also typically provide search capabilities, something the EPUB Creator
						cannot provide, so users also have a third option available in most cases.</p>

					<p>Although EPUB Creators only need to follow EPUB requirements to meet this criterion, they are
						still encouraged to provide additional methods to improve access beyond the minimum. Some
						suggestions include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>adding at least one link to every Content Document in the spine to the table of contents,
								when feasible;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>adding an index to locate major topics; and</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>adding additional navigation aids to the EPUB Navigation Document (e.g., lists of figures
								and tables).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<section id="sec-access-002-toc">
						<h5>Note About the Table of Contents</h5>

						<p>A common question about the EPUB table of contents is what completeness it needs to have with
							respect to the headings of the publication. Although the obvious answer seems like it should
							be a simple aggregation of all headings for all sections, practically there are several
							usability challenges to this approach.</p>

						<p>Factors such as device screen sizes can make the table of contents for publications with a
							deep hierarchy of headings unreadable, so EPUB Creators will trim headings below a certain
							depth to improve the readability. Further, Reading Systems do not always provide structured
							access to the headings in the table of contents, or provide shortcuts to navigate the links.
							The result is that users have to listen to each link one at a time to find where they want
							to go, a tedious and time-consuming process.</p>

						<p>Although it is expected that Reading Systems will improve access to the table of contents as
							accessibility support for EPUB evolves — making complete tables of contents usable by
							everyone — there are legitimate usability reasons why they are not provided now.</p>

						<p>When EPUB Creators choose not to provide links to all the headings, however, they should
							optimize the linking they do provide for the best overall reading experience. Some
							considerations on how to achieve this include:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>ensuring that there is at least one link to every EPUB Content Document — allowing
									the user to reach each document simplifies navigation to the minor headings within
									them; and</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>only omitting minor headings from the table of contents — although a subjective
									decision, there is often a level of diminishing value for navigation (e.g., fourth
									level and lower headings often only delimit short subsections on a topic).</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section id="access-003">
					<h4>Ensure the order of table of contents entries matches linear order</h4>

					<p>The table of contents provides users more than just links into the content. It is also a means to
						understand the structure and ordering of an EPUB Publication. Consequently, users may have
						difficulty locating where they are in a publication, where they want to go, and also how to
						return to previous locations when the order of entries in the table of contents does not match
						the linear reading order.</p>

					<p>EPUB Creators should therefore ensure that the entries in the table of contents always match the
						linear order of the content. Specifically, the order of entries should reflect both:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the order of EPUB Content Documents in the <code>spine</code>; and</li>
						<li>the order of each referenced section within its respective Content Document.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Only if there is a logical case for an alternative arrangement of entries should the ordering
						differ. Such scenarios typically only occur when the content does not have to be read linearly
						or when additional information is included at the end of a table of contents. For example, the
						table of contents for a magazine might be ordered to list all the major articles first, followed
						by features, etc.</p>

					<p>When the ordering of the table of contents does not match the content, EPUB Creators should
						include an explanation why in the <a href="#meta-005">accessibility summary</a>.</p>

					<p>EPUB Creators should avoid including links to supplementary content at the end of the table of
						contents. Links to figure, tables, illustrations and similar content is better included as a
						separate navigation elements (either in the EPUB Navigation Document or in the spine). EPUB
						Creators can include links to these additional navigation lists in the table of contents.</p>

				<h3>Semantics</h3>

				<section id="sem-001">
					<h4>ARIA roles and <code>epub:type</code></h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The following guidance is only for EPUB Content Documents. The <code>type</code> attribute is
							the only means of adding structural information to Media Overlay Documents so that features
							like lists and tables can be navigated more efficiently. It is also required in the EPUB
							Navigation Document to identify key structures.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Although the <code>role</code> attribute may seem similar in nature to the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"
						><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[EPUB-3]], their target uses in EPUB Content Documents do not
						overlap.</p>

					<p>The key difference between these attributes is that the <code>role</code> attribute bridges
						accessibility in content while the <code>type</code> attribute provides hooks to enable Reading
						System behaviors. Omitting roles lessens the accessibility for users of Assistive Technologies,
						in other words, while omitting types diminishes certain functionality in Reading Systems (e.g.,
						pop-up footnotes or special presentations of the content).</p>

					<p>Since each attribute offers different advantages, it is not necessary that they be used together.
						Due to the lack of restrictions on where EPUB Creators can use the <code>type</code> attribute,
						pairing the attributes may cause accessibility issues (e.g., putting roles on the [[HTML]]
							<code>body</code> element).</p>

					<p>In particular, the use of the <code>type</code> attribute is not a means of satisyfing
						requirements for ARIA roles in WCAG.</p>

					<p>For EPUB Creators looking to move from the <code>type</code> attribute to using ARIA roles, the
							<a href="https://idpf.github.io/epub-guides/epub-aria-authoring/">EPUB Type to ARIA Role
							Authoring Guide</a> guide details notable authoring differences between the two attributes.
						It also includes a mapping table of semantics in the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary to
						equivalent ARIA roles in [[DPUB-ARIA-1.0]] and [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]].</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sem-002">
					<h4>Do not repeat semantics across chunked content</h4>

					<p>Although EPUB Publications appear as single contiguous documents to users when read, they are
						typically composed of many individual EPUB Content Documents. This practice keeps the amount of
						markup that has to be rendered small to reduce the load time in Reading Systems (i.e., to
						minimize the time the user has to wait for a document to appear). It is rare, at least for
						books, for an EPUB Publication to contain only one Content Document with all the content in
						it.</p>

					<p>When content is chunked in this way, it often requires the EPUB Creator to make decisions about
						how best to restructure the information. A part, for example, will typically not include all the
						chapters that belong to it. The EPUB Creator will instead separate the part heading from each
						chapter, putting each into a separate document.</p>

					<p>Although visually these restructuring decisions can be hidden from readers, they impact the
						functionality of Assistive Technologies. In the case of [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] roles, the result is
						that only the subset present in the currently-loaded EPUB Content Document are exposed to users.
						An Assistive Technology cannot provide a list of landmarks for the whole publication, as it
						cannot see outside the current document.</p>

					<p>To counteract this destructuring effect, EPUB Creators sometimes think to re-add or re-identify
						structures in the belief that having this information in every document will be helpful to users
						(e.g., adding an extra [[HTML]] <code>section</code> element around a chapter to indicate it
						belongs to a part, or putting the part semantic on the <code>body</code> tag). All this practice
						does, however, is add repetition that is not only disruptive when reading but can make the
						structure of the publication harder to follow. EPUB Creators are therefore advised not to
						attempt to rebuild structures in these ways.</p>

					<p>For example, consider a book that has five parts and each part contains five chapters.
						Structurally, each chapter belongs to its part (i.e., is grouped with it), as in the following
						markup:</p>

					<pre>&lt;section
    role="doc-part">
   &lt;h1>Part 1&lt;/h1>
   
   &lt;section
       role="doc-chapter">
      &lt;h2>Chapter 1&lt;/h2>
      …
   &lt;/section>
   …
&lt;/section></pre>

					<p>Since this would lead to a large content file, the part heading is typically split out into its
						own Content Document so that it will appear on its own page:</p>

					<pre>&lt;html … >
   …
   &lt;body
       role="doc-part">
      &lt;h1>Part 1&lt;/h1>
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

					<p>Each chapter is then separated into a separate Content Document:</p>

					<pre>&lt;html … >
   …
   &lt;body
       role="doc-chapter">
      &lt;h2>Chapter 1&lt;/h2>
      …
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

					<p>It is not necessary to add a part wrapper to each chapter, as in the following example:</p>

					<pre>&lt;html … >
   …
   &lt;body
       role="doc-part">
      &lt;section
          role="doc-chapter">
         &lt;h2>Chapter 1&lt;/h2>
         …
      &lt;/section>
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>

					<p>Doing so introduces a new <code>part</code> landmark into each document, which will cause an
						Assistive Technology to inform the user that the landmark is available to navigate to.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sem-003">
					<h4>Include EPUB landmarks</h4>

					<p>[[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.1#dfn-landmark">landmarks</a> are similar in nature to
							<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-landmarks">EPUB landmarks</a> [[EPUB-3]]: both
						are designed to provide users with quick access to the major structures of a document, such as
						chapters, glossaries and indexes. ARIA landmarks are compiled automatically by Assistive
						Technologies from the <a href="#sem-001">roles</a> that have been applied to the markup, so EPUB
						Creators only need to follow the requirement to include roles for the landmarks to be made
						available to users.</p>

					<p>Although automatic generation of ARIA landmarks simplifies authoring, it also means that ARIA
						landmarks are limited to how the EPUB Publication has been chunked up into Content Documents. An
						Assistive Technology can only present the landmarks available in the currently-loaded document;
						it cannot provide a complete picture of all the landmarks in a multi-document publication (see
						the <a href="#sem-002">previous section</a> for more discussion about content chunking).</p>

					<p>EPUB landmarks, on the other hand, are compiled by the EPUB Creator prior to distribution, and
						are not directly linked to the use of the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-epub-type-attribute"
						><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[EPUB-3]] in the content. They are designed to simplify
						linking to major sections of the publication in a machine-readable way, as Reading Systems do
						not scan the entire publication for landmarks, either. EPUB landmarks are typically not as
						numerous as ARIA landmarks, as Reading Systems only expose so many of these navigation aids.</p>

					<p>Given these differences in application, however, it is important to include EPUB landmarks and
						not rely only on the presence of ARIA roles to facilitate navigation, and vice versa. Each aids
						navigation in its own way.</p>

					<p>The EPUB specification does not require that EPUB Creators include a specific set of landmarks,
						but it is recommended to include a link to the start of the body matter as well as to any major
						reference sections (e.g., table of contents, endnotes, bibliography, glossary, index).</p>

					<h4>Include publication and document titles</h4>

					<p>[[WCAG2]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#page-titled">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> requires
						that each Web page include a title. EPUB has a similar requirement for EPUB Publications:
						publications require a [[DCTERMS]] <code>title</code> element in the Package Document metadata.
						The [[WCAG2]] requirement is not satisfied by the EPUB requirement, however.</p>

					<p>When authoring an EPUB Publication each EPUB Content Document also requires a descriptive title
						that describes its content. If not provided, Assistive Technologies often will announce the name
						of the file to users.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Title for an EPUB Content Document">

					<h4>Ensure numbered headings reflect publication hierarchy</h4>

					<p>To a user, an EPUB Publication appears as a single document that they read from beginning to end,
						even though the content is often split across numerous EPUB Content Documents. As a result,
						their natural expectation is that the headings reflect their position in the overall hierarchy
						of the publication, despite the publication not actually being a single document (e.g., if a
						part heading is expressed in an [[HTML]] <code>h1</code> element, each chapter that belongs to
						the part will have an <code>h2</code> heading).</p>

					<p>Technique <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G141">G141: Organizing a page
							using headings</a> instructs EPUB Creators on correctly using numbered headings within a
						document, but with EPUB Publications the numbered headings also need to remain consistent across
						documents. Practically, this means that each EPUB Content Document does not have to begin with
						an <code>h1</code> heading unless the first heading is a top-level heading — the first heading
						needs to have a numbered heading element that reflects its actual position in the
						publication.</p>

					<p>EPUB Creators also to need chunk their content so that the first heading in a document always has
						the highest number. For example, if a document starts with an <code>h3</code> heading, there
						should not be an <code>h2</code> heading later in the document (e.g., do not include the start
						of a new section with the trailing subsections of the previous). It is acceptable for there to
						be subsequent headings at the same level as the first (e.g., multiple subsections in one
						document could all have <code>h3</code> headings).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Heading order across documents">

					<h4>Heading topic or purpose</h4>

					<p>[[WCAG2]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#non-text-content">Success Criterion 2.4.6</a>
						currently states that all headings must describe their topic or purpose. The implication of this
						wording is that all chapters in a novel, for example, have a topic or purpose and that the topic
						or purpose is always clearly reflected by the title of the chapter. Not only is this not always
						the case, but this success criterion also complicates the use of chapter numbers as headings
						since these do not establish a topic.</p>

					<p>After discussion in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/2039">Accessibility
							Guidelines Working Group's issue tracker</a>, it is clear that the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels">understanding
							document for 2.4.6</a> captures the intent of the success criterion better than the current
						wording &#8212; namely, that the requirement for headings is only that they establish a unique
						context for the content.</p>

					<p>By this interpretation, the headings in publications should always pass provided they are
						unique.</p>

					<p>It is expected that the wording of the success criterion will be updated to better reflect the
						uniqueness requirement, likely in the future WCAG 3 due the complexities of changing the wording
						for WCAG 2.</p>

					<h4>Language of Package Document</h4>

					<p>[[WCAG2]] Success Criterions <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#language-of-page">3.1.1</a>
						and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#language-of-parts">3.1.2</a> deal with the language of
						a page and changes of language with in, respectively.</p>

					<p>For EPUB Publications, the Package Document is also an important source of metadata information
						about the publication. For example, Reading Systems expose details of the publications to users
						in their bookshelves using this information.</p>

					<p>Consequently, it is necessary to provide the language of all text content in the Package Document
						to conform with these WCAG success criteria. The easiest way to meet this requirement is to add
						an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute on the root <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-package-elem"><code>package</code> element</a>
						[[EPUB-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="All text declared to be in Japanese by default">
						<pre><code>&lt;package … xml:lang="jp">
   …
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>If individual metadata fields within the Package Document are expressed in a different language,
						it is similarly required that the language change be identified by an <code>xml:lang</code>
						attribute on the element for the field.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Overriding the default language for a title">
						<pre><code>&lt;package … xml:lang="en">

      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Providing this information enables Reading Systems to correctly render the text content in the
						proper language for users.</p>

					<p class="note">The languages specified in the Package Document have no effect on individual EPUB
						Content Documents (i.e., the language of each document must be specified using the language
						expression mechanisms it provides).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="lang-002">
					<h4>Language of the EPUB Publication</h4>

					<p>In addition to being able to express the language of text content, the Package Document also

						[[EPUB-3]].</p>

						only informative, it should be considered a best practice to always set this field with the
						proper language information. (Note that EPUB3 requires the language always be specified, so
						omitting will fail validation requirements.)</p>

					<p>Although Reading Systems do not use this language information to render the text content of the

				<h3>Text</h3>

					<h4>Use Unicode for text content</h4>

					<p>[[WCAG2]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#non-text-content">Success Criterion 1.1.1</a>
						requires that text equivalents be provided for all non-text content to meet Level A. In some
						regions (e.g., Asia), it is not uncommon to find images of individual text characters, despite
						the availability of Unicode character equivalents. This practice occurs for various reasons,
						such as ease of translation of older documents and for compatibility across Reading Systems. The
						use of images in most instances leads to the text not being accessible to non-visual users,
						however.</p>

					<p>When individual characters are replaced by images, there is invariably a negative effect on
						text-to-speech playback, even when alternative text is provided (e.g., if single characters
						within a word are replaced by images, the word will not be read as a single unit of text). It is
						also problematic for visual users, as the images often scale poorly and the characters cannot be
						changed to different font families to meet user preferences.</p>

					<p>The use of Unicode characters for all text content avoids this problem, allowing content to
						successfully meet the minimum requirement for Level A.</p>

					<p>For compliance with Level AA, EPUB Creators are directed to <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#images-of-text">Success Criterion 1.4.5</a> which further
						restricts the use of images of text to only a set of essential cases.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-wcag-alt">
				<h3>Accessible Alternatives</h3>

				<p>As EPUB Publications can be composed of more than one rendition, it is possible that different
					versions of the content will have different levels of accessibility. For example, an image-based
					version of the content that lacks alternative text or descriptions could be bundled with a
					WCAG-compliant text-based serialization. This type of accessible bundling is acceptable, as
					[[WCAG2]] allows non-conforming content provided a <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternate
						version</a> is available.</p>

				<p>The [[EPUBMultipleRenditions-10]] specification defines a set of features for creating these types of
					EPUB Publications. It specifies a set of attributes that allow a Reading System to automatically
					select a preferred rendition for the user or to provide the user the option to manually select
					between the available options. This functionality technically meets the requirements of [[WCAG2]] in
					terms of ensuring the user can access the accessible version.</p>

				<p>In practice, however, the [[EPUBMultipleRenditions-10]] specification is not broadly supported in
					Reading Systems at the time of publication. As a result, a user who obtains an EPUB Publication that
					contains more than one rendition will only have access to the default. Unless this rendition is the
					accessible one, the EPUB Publication might not be readable by them.</p>

				<p>EPUB Creators therefore need to use their best discretion when implementing this functionality to
					meet accessibility requirements. EPUB Publications that contain multiple renditions are conformant
					to the [[EPUB-A11Y-11]] specification if at least one rendition meets all the content requirements,
					but EPUB Creators at a minimum need to note that a Reading System that supports multiple renditions
					is required in their <a href="#meta-005">accessibility summary</a>. Any other methods the EPUB
					Creator can use to make this dependence known is advisable (e.g., in the <a href="#dist-002"
						>distribution metadata</a>).</p>

				<p>This section will be updated with techniques for using multiple renditions when there is enough
					support in Reading Systems to broadly recommend their use.</p>

			<h2>EPUB Techniques</h2>

			<section id="sec-epub-page-markers">
				<h3>Page Markers</h3>

				<section id="page-001">
					<h4>Provide page break markers</h4>

					<p>Both the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary [[EPUB-SSV]] and Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA 1.0
						Module [[DPUB-ARIA-1.0]] include a semantic for static page breaks: <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#pagebreak">pagebreak</a> and <a
							data-cite="dpub-aria-1.0#doc-pagebreak">doc-pagebreak</a>, respectively.</p>

					<p>It is recommended that both semantics be applied to EPUB 3 content to ensure maximum
						compatibility with Reading Systems and Assistive Technologies.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expressing a page break">
						<p>In this example, the EPUB Creator identifies an HTML <code>span</code> element as a page
							break.</p>
						<pre>&lt;span
    id="page001"
    epub:type="pagebreak"
    role="doc-pagebreak"
    aria-label="1"/></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>A <code>title</code> or <code>aria-label</code> attribute is required on the element, as it
						provides the value that is announced to the user. Do not include the page number as text
						content, as this practice forces the user to hear it announced wherever it occurs (e.g., without
						any context in the middle of a sentence).</p>

					<p>EPUB 2 does not include markup to identify static page break marks in the content. Page break
						destinations can be included to enable hyperlinking, but the <a href="#page-003">page
						list</a> is the only way a user can jump to the locations.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Adding a hyperlink destination">
						<p>In this example, the EPUB Creator adds an XHTML 1.1 <code>span</code> element to use as a
							hyperlink destination.</p>
						<pre>&lt;html …>
   …
   &lt;body>
      …
      &lt;span id="page001"/>
      …
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Do not use the [[HTML]] <a data-cite="html#the-a-element"><code>a</code> element</a> to identify
						page break locations in EPUB 3 Publications. Although this element was previously defined as the
						anchor for a hyperlink destination, its purpose has been changed in [[HTML]] for use solely as a
						link.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="page-002">
					<h4>Identify pages in audio playback</h4>

					<p>Readers rarely stop reading to review each new page number, so when page numbers are read aloud
						in the audio playback of a publication it is not only distracting, but can be confusing, as well
						(e.g., the number could be read out in the middle of a sentence).</p>

					<p>To mitigate this potential annoyance to readers, EPUB Creators need to identify page
						announcements in the EPUB 3 media overlays document when they are included. Identification
						allows a Reading System to provide a playback experience where the numbers are automatically
						skipped.</p>

					<p>To identify page numbers in EPUB 3 Publications, attach an <code>epub:type</code> attribute with
						the value "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code></a>"
						[[EPUB-SSV]] to each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-smil-par-elem"><code>par</code>

					<h4>Provide a page list</h4>

					<p>A page list — a list of hyperlinks to the static page break locations — is the most effective way
						for users to find static page locations. Without a page list, the user would have to navigate
						each page marker in the text, provided they are available and the Reading System provides such
						functionality.</p>

					<p>When a page list is included, Reading Systems can provide users direct access to the list or use
						it to provide automatic page jump functionality.</p>

					<h4>Identify the pagination source</h4>

					<p>Users typically want to know the source of the page break markers included in an EPUB Publication
						when they are derived from a static media. Considerations like which printing, by which
						publisher or imprint, and whether the pagination comes from the hard or soft cover edition will
						affect decisions about its usefulness (e.g., does it exactly match the pagination of a print
						book used in a classroom).</p>

					<p>To allow users to determine the suitability of the pagination, identify the ISBN of the source
						work in the Package Document metadata.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Expressing the source of pagination">
						<p>In this example, the <code>dc:source</code> element contains the ISBN of the print source of
							pagination. This example is valid for both EPUB 2 and 3.</p>
						<pre>&lt;metadata …>
   …
   &lt;dc:source>
      urn:isbn:9780375704024
   &lt;/dc:source>
   …
&lt;/metadata></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>EPUB 3 allows the source of pagination to be explicitly identified using the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#source-of"><code>source-of</code> property</a> with the
						value "<code>pagination</code>" [[EPUB-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Adding a source-of declaration">
						<p>In this example, a <code>dc:source</code> element is explicitly identified as the source of
							pagination. The <code>refines</code> attribute identifies the ID of the element the
								<code>source-of</code> property is modifying.</p>
						<pre>&lt;metadata …>
   …
   &lt;dc:source
       id="pg-src">

       refines="#pg-src">
      pagination
   &lt;/meta>
   …
&lt;/metadata></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>The <code>source-of</code> property is particularly useful when there are multiple sources for an
						EPUB Publication as it disambiguates which one the pagination came from.</p>

					<p>If an ISBN is not available, include as much information as possible about the source publication
						(e.g., the publisher, date, edition, and binding).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Text description of the source">
						<pre>&lt;metadata …>

			<h2>Distribution Techniques</h2>

				<h3>Do not restrict access through digital rights management</h3>

				<p>EPUB Publications typically require preservation of the publisher's and author's intellectual
					property when distributed (e.g., so that they can be made available for individual sale through
					online bookstores or distributed through library systems). The most common way to address this need
					has been through the application of digital rights management (DRM) schemes to the packaged EPUB
					Publication. DRM enables a variety of security features that aren't native to the EPUB format, such
					as the ability to limit access to a single user and to limit the length of time the person can
					access the publication (e.g., library loans).</p>

				<p>In general, DRM can be made to work interoperably with Assistive Technologies, but problems arise
					when DRM restrictions remove direct access to an EPUB Publication or restrict access to the content
					within it. Unless the Reading System implementing the DRM provides API level access to the content,
					it can prove difficult, or even impossible, to generate text-to-speech playback, or for a
					refreshable braille display to have access to the underlying text, as well as cause other
					accessibility issues.</p>

				<p>The application of digital rights management therefore must not impair or impede the functionality of
					Assistive Technologies on EPUB Publications users have the right to access.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="dist-002">
				<h3>Include accessibility metadata in distribution records</h3>

				<p>When an EPUB Publication is ingested into a distribution system, such as a bookstore or library, a
					metadata record is often provided separately to the distributor. In these scenarios, the metadata
					used to enable discovery of the publication typically comes from the distribution record alone, not
					from the metadata in the Package Document.</p>

				<p>The result is that it is necessary to include as much accessibility metadata in distribution records
					as their vocabularies allow.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The use of distribution records does not remove the requirement to include accessibility metadata
						in the Package Document. The metadata in the Package Document ensures accessibility information
						is always available with the publication.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="ONIX accessibility metadata">
					<p>In this example, the ONIX record includes accessibility metadata that states that the EPUB
						Publication has no accessibility features disabled (10), includes a table of contents (11) and

			<ul>
				<li>10-Nov-2021: Added techniques for setting language in the Package Document. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1842">issue 1842</a>.</li>
				<li>25-Oct-2021: Removed the generic technique labels for each section. See <a

				<li>29-Sep-2021: Added <a href="#titles-003">TITLES-003</a> to explain that headings only have to be
					unique, not define the topic or purpose of a section. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1810">issue 1810</a>.</li>
				<li>10-June-2021: Clarified the technique on meaningful sequence that it applies to content that spans
					pages in a spread and is not about ordering documents in the spine. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1695">issue 1695</a>.</li>
				<li>25-May-2021: Updated the section on ARIA roles to make clear that the <code>epub:type</code>
					attribute does not have to be used in coordination, nor that roles are required where
						<code>epub:type</code> is used.</li>
				<li>13-Apr-2021: Added an example of using the <code>source-of</code> property in EPUB 3 to identify
					which <code>dc:source</code> element is the source of pagination. See <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1600">issue 1600</a>.</li>
				<li>19-Feb-2021: References to WCAG 2.0 have been updated to undated references to WCAG 2 (except where
					WCAG 2.0 is explicitly mentioned for conformance).</li>
				<li>08-Jan-2021: Added technique recommending the <a href="#access-003">order of the table of
						contents</a> match the linear reading order of content.</li>
				<li>16-Nov-2020: The techniques for <a href="#meta-007">accessibility controls</a> and <a
						href="#meta-006">APIs</a> have been replaced with descriptions of why these properties are not
					necessary to set. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1286">issue 1286</a>.</li>
