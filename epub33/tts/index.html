			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The need for clear and accurate [=Text-to-Speech=] (TTS) rendering of publications is imperative for
					their readability and comprehension. Unfortunately, the complexities of voicing natural languages
					and the limitations of built-in vocabularies in TTS engines often leads to incorrect and illegible
					voicing. Users either have to infer the correct meaning, when possible, or stop reading and have the
					garbled words spelled out. Anyone who has tried to read educational or instructional material using
					basic TTS playback will understand the frustration of this experience.</p>

				<p>W3C has defined a variety of technologies to aid in improving the voice rendering of markup content:
					the Synthetic Speech Markup Language [[ssml]], pronunciation lexicons [[pronunciation-lexicon]], and
					the CSS Speech module.</p>

				<p>SSML and pronunciation lexicons provide enhanced speech rendering. Lexicons are like dictionaries of
					common terms a TTS engine can use, while SSML provides the ability to add individual voicing for
					specific phrases. [=EPUB creators=] can use these technologies together or separately depending on
					the complexity of the text. Despite these advantages, the technologies have not been adapted for
					easy use within the XHTML and SVG formats that EPUB relies on. This document proposes an approach to
					enable their authoring and rendering in EPUB content documents.</p>

				<p>This document also covers the use of CSS Speech for improved aural rendering in EPUB. CSS Speech
					covers a different domain than SSML and pronunciation lexicons. Instead of controlling the specific
					voicing of words and phrases, these properties allow EPUB creators to aspects of the aural playback
					itself &#8212; what text to render, at what volume, with what preferred voice, etc.</p>

				<p>This document covers the use of these technologies for rendering by [=EPUB reading systems=].
					Although it is anticipated that general assistive technologies such as screen readers could take
					advantage of the technologies, use by them is out of scope.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="background" class="informative">
				<h3>Background</h3>

				<p>The EPUB Working Group of the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) first defined a means of
					integrating the Synthetic Speech Markup Language [[ssml]] and pronunciation lexicons
					[[pronunciation-lexicon]] in EPUB 3.0 [[epubcontentdocs-30]] so that [=EPUB creators=] could improve
					the rendering quality of [=text-to-speech=] (TTS) playback in [=reading systems=]. The ability to
					include cascading style sheets [[css2]] also allowed EPUB creators to access the in-development
					speech properties of the CSS Speech module [[css-speech-1]].</p>

				<p>Although there has been some authoring uptake of these technologies, support in reading systems has
					yet to materialize to a level where these technologies are considered stable. Consequently, these
					technologies are now published as a W3C Working Group Note.</p>

				<p>EPUB creators can continue to use these technologies in their publications, as the move to a Note
					does not change their validity or affect backward compatibility. Developers of reading systems that
					support TTS playback are also strongly encouraged to implement support. The Working Group will look
					at standardizing any of the technologies that meet support requirements in future revisions of EPUB
					3.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The <a data-cite="spoken-html#">Specification for Spoken Presentation in HTML</a> [[spoken-html]]
						is another initiative in W3C to bring SSML to HTML. It is still too early to determine what
						effect, if any, it will have on this document. The Working Group will monitor the work and
						future updates to this Note will reflect any impact it has on Text-to-Speech rendering in
						EPUB.</p>

			<h2>SSML attributes</h2>

			<section id="ssml-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>The W3C Speech Synthesis Markup Language [[ssml]] is a language used for assisting [=Text-to-Speech=]
					(TTS) engines in generating synthetic speech. Although SSML is designed as a standalone document
					type, it also defines semantics suitable for use within other markup languages.</p>

				<p>This specification recasts the [[ssml]] <a data-cite="speech-synthesis11#S3.1.10"
							><code>phoneme</code> element</a> as two attributes — <code>ssml:ph</code> and
						<code>ssml:alphabet</code> — and makes them available within [=EPUB content documents=].</p>

				<p>The attributes allow EPUB creators to specify the proper phonetic pronunciation for uncommon terms
					that a TTS engine is likely to mispronounce, as well as to disambiguate heteronyms.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="ssml-ph-attribute">
				<h3>The <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute</h3>

				<p>The <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute specifies a phonemic/phonetic pronunciation of the text
					represented by its carrying element.</p>

				<dl class="elemdef" id="attrdef-ssml-ph">
					<dt>Attribute Name</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							<code>ph</code>
						</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Namespace</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>
							<code>https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis</code>
						</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Usage</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>EPUB creators MAY specify on any element in EPUB content documents with which they can
							logically associate a phonetic equivalent (i.e., that has descendant text content that a
							Text-to-Speech engine would otherwise render).</p>
						<p>EPUB creators MUST NOT specify the attribute on a descendant of an element that already
							carries this attribute.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Value</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A phonemic/phonetic expression, syntactically valid with respect to <a
								href="#ssml-alphabet-attribute">the phonemic/phonetic alphabet used</a>.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>The <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute inherits the authoring requirements of the [[ssml]]
						<code>phoneme</code> element's <a data-cite="speech-synthesis11#S3.1.10"><code>ph</code></a>
					attribute.</p>

				<p id="ssml-ph-concat">When the <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute appears on an element that has text node
					descendants, the corresponding document text to which the pronunciation applies is the string that
					results from concatenating the descendant text nodes, in document order. The specified phonetic
					pronunciation must therefore logically match the element's textual data in its entirety (i.e., not
					just an isolated part of its content).</p>

				<p id="ssml-ph-text">EPUB creators SHOULD NOT use the <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute on elements without
					text content that a Text-to-Speech engine would normally render (e.g., on empty <code>div</code> or
						<code>span</code> elements). The attribute is not intended to add additional voicing only for
					TTS playback, and reading systems are expected to ignore the attribute if it does not replace text
					they would normally render.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The <code>ssml:ph</code> attribute does not replace attribute values that carry additional
						textual information (e.g., [^img/alt^] [[html]] and <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-label"><code>aria-label</code></a> [[wai-aria]])
						or link additional textual information (e.g., <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-describedby"><code>aria-describedby</code></a>
						[[wai-aria]]).</p>
				</div>

				<p id="ssml-ph-empty">Similarly, EPUB creators SHOULD NOT add empty <code>ssml:ph</code> attributes to
					try and suppress the rendering of text. Reading systems are expected to ignore empty attributes.
					(See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-hidden"><code>aria-hidden</code>
						attribute</a> [[?wai-aria]] for specifying that content is only for visual rendering.)</p>

				<p id="ssml-alphabet-inherit">The value of the <code>ssml:alphabet</code> attribute is inherited in the

			<h2>Pronunciation lexicons</h2>

			<section id="pls-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>The W3C Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS) [[pronunciation-lexicon]] defines syntax and
					semantics for XML-based pronunciation lexicons to be used by Automatic Speech Recognition and
					[=Text-to-Speech=] (TTS) engines.</p>

				<p>Pronunciation lexicons allow EPUB creators to define a single global phonetic pronunciation that
					reading systems can use for all instances of a term instead of having to tag every instance using
					the SSML attributes. It is a much more efficient way of defining pronunciations for words with only
					a single pronunciation, or where a particular pronunciation is predominant.</p>

				<p>EPUB creators can use the [[html]] <a data-cite="html#the-link-element"><code>link</code> element</a>
					and [[svg]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#HTMLMetadataElements"><code>link</code>
						element</a> to associate one or more lexicons with their respective [=EPUB content document=]
					type. When reading systems process the documents, they can identify the linked lexicons and use them
