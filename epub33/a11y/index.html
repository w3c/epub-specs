		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>This specification, EPUB Accessibility, addresses two key needs in the EPUB ecosystem:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>discoverability of the accessible qualities of <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>; and</li>
					<li>evaluation and certification of accessible EPUB publications.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The provision of accessibility metadata facilitates informed decisions about the usability of an EPUB
					publication. Consumers can review the qualities of the content and decide whether an EPUB
					publication is appropriate for their needs, regardless of whether it meets the bar of accessible
					certification. At a minimum, all EPUB publications that conform to this specification meet the
					accessibility metadata requirements described in <a href="#sec-discovery"></a>.</p>

				<p>Although <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> have always been
					able to create EPUB publications with a high degree of accessibility, this specification sets formal
					requirements for certifying content accessible. These requirements provide EPUB creators a clear set
					of guidelines to evaluate their content against and allows certification of quality. An accessible
					EPUB publication is one that meets the accessibility requirements described in <a
						href="#sec-accessible-pubs"></a>.</p>

				<p>The specification also discusses the practice of optimizing EPUB publications for specific reading
					modalities. In these cases, the content cannot meet the broad accessibility requirements of this
					specification, but by following its discoverability and reporting requirements EPUB creators can
					improve the ability of users to determine if the content still meets their needs. Refer to <a
						href="#sec-optimized-pubs"></a> for more information.</p>

				<p>The specification also addresses the impact of distribution on the accessibility and discoverability
					of content in <a href="#sec-distribution"></a>.</p>

				<p>This specification does not target a single version of EPUB. It is applicable to EPUB publications
					that conform to any version or profile, including future versions of the standard.</p>

				<p>Ideally, these guidelines help evaluate any digital publication built on Open Web Platform
					technologies, although ensuring such application is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For additional background on the decisions that went into this specification, refer to <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/docs/a11y-faq/">EPUB Accessibility Frequently Asked
							Questions</a>.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-success-techniques" class="informative">
				<h3>Success techniques</h3>

				<p>This specification takes an abstract approach to the accessibility requirements for <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>, similar to how
					WCAG [[wcag2]] separates its accessibility guidelines from the techniques to achieve them. This
					approach allows the guidelines to remain stable even as the format evolves.</p>

				<p>To facilitate this approach, the companion <a data-cite="epub-a11y-tech-11#">EPUB Accessibility
						Techniques</a> [[epub-a11y-tech-11]] document outlines conformance techniques. These techniques
					explain how to meet the requirements of this specification for different versions of EPUB.</p>

				<section id="sec-sc-i18n">
					<h4>Internationalization</h4>

					<p>This specification is also designed to address the accessibility needs of users independent of
						what languages they read. The same is true for the principles and success criteria defined in
						[[wcag2]]. The goal is to ensure that users can fully consume the information of a publication
						regardless of their preferred reading modality.</p>

					<p>At the same time, the language and writing conventions of the authored text will influence the
						techniques necessary to meet the accessibility requirements. EPUB <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#confreq-xml-enc">requires support for Unicode text</a>
						[[epub-3]], for example, which ensures the correct character data can be used (i.e., <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> do not have to use
						images of text). Although this is an important feature, it is often not enough on its own to
						ensure that the text is fully accessible in any given language (e.g., additional information
						about directionality, emphasis, pronunciation, etc. may also be needed).</p>

					<p>As a consequence, there may be language- or culture-specific practices for meeting accessibility
						requirements. Whether these practices are defined within this specification and its techniques
						or elsewhere (e.g., in WCAG techniques or language-specific best practice recommendations) will
						depend on whether the issues are specific to EPUB or broadly affect all web content.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-application" class="informative">
				<h3>Application to older versions</h3>

				<p>This specification is applicable to any <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication"
						>EPUB publication</a>, even if the content conforms to an older version of EPUB that does not
					refer to this specification (e.g., EPUB 2 [[opf-201]]).</p>

				<p>Creators of such EPUB publications should create content in conformance with the accessibility and
					discoverability requirements of this specification. <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> should also upgrade to the
					latest version of EPUB to get access to the most advanced accessibility features and techniques.</p>

				<p>Note that not all metadata expressions defined in this specification are supported in older version
					of EPUB. EPUB 2, in particular, does not support the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#attrdef-refines"><code>refines</code> attribute</a>
					[[epub-3]]. If EPUB creators cannot avoid expressions that require this attribute, they will have to
					accept a certain amount of ambiguity in their statements (i.e., relationships between expression may
					only be apparent by their placement in the package document metadata).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This specification uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-terminology">terminology defined in
						EPUB 3</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

				<p>It also defines the following term:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt><dfn id="dfn-assistive-technology" data-lt="assistive techonolgies">assistive
						technology</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This specification uses the <a data-cite="wcag2#dfn-assistive-technologies">definition of
								assistive technology</a> from [[wcag2]].</p>
						<p>In the case of EPUB, an assistive technology is not always a separate application from a <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a>. Reading
							systems often integrate features of standalone assistive technologies, such as
							text-to-speech playback.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section links to its definition.</p>

			<section id="conformance"></section>

		<section id="sec-discovery">
			<h2>Discoverability</h2>

			<section id="sec-disc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Unlike web pages, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> distribute
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> through many
					channels for personal consumption â a model that has made EPUB a successful format for ebooks and
					other types of digital publications. A consequence of this model, however, is that specific details
					about the accessibility of a publication must travel with it.</p>

				<p>An online bookstore aggregating content from publishers and authors, for example, does not know the
					production quality that went into each submission unless the publisher informs them through
					metadata.</p>

				<p>Ensuring that any interested party can discover the accessible qualities of an EPUB publication is
					therefore a primary concern. An EPUB publication can have more than one set of sufficient <a
						href="#confreq-schema-accessMode">access modes</a> depending on the alternatives provided to
					enable reading in another mode. For example, if alternative text and descriptions are provided for
					all the images in a publication, it would have both its default textual and visual sufficient access
					mode <em>and</em> a purely textual sufficient access mode.</p>

				<p>Similarly, content that does not meet the accessibility requirements of this specification does not
					necessarily fail to meet the needs of individual users.</p>

				<p>Only through the provision of rich metadata can a user decide if the content is suitable for
					them.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-disc-package">
				<h3>Package metadata</h3>

				<p>All <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> MUST include
					[[schema-org]] accessibility metadata in the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a> that exposes their
					accessible properties, regardless of whether the publications also meet the <a
						href="#sec-accessible-pubs">accessibility</a> or <a href="#sec-optimized-pubs">optimization</a>
					requirements.</p>

				<p>EPUB publications MUST include the following accessibility metadata:</p>

				<ul class="conformance-list">
					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessMode"><a href="https://schema.org/accessMode">accessMode</a> â a
							human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty necessary to process or perceive the
							content (e.g., textual, visual, auditory, tactile).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilityFeature"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"
								>accessibilityFeature</a> â features and adaptations that contribute to the overall
							accessibility of the content (e.g., alternative text, extended descriptions, captions).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilityHazard"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"
								>accessibilityHazard</a> â any potential hazards that the content presents (e.g.,
							flashing, motion simulation, sound).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>EPUB publications SHOULD include the following [[schema-org]] accessibility metadata:</p>

				<ul class="conformance-list">
					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilitySummary"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary"
								>accessibilitySummary</a> â a human-readable summary of the accessibility that
							complements, but does not duplicate, the other discoverability metadata. The summary also
							describes any known deficiencies (e.g., lack of extended descriptions, specific
							hazards).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessModeSufficient"><a href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"
								>accessModeSufficient</a> â a set of one or more access modes sufficient to consume the
							content without significant loss of information. An EPUB publication can have more than one
							set of sufficient access modes for its consumption depending on the types of content it
							includes (i.e., unlike <a href="#confreq-schema-accessMode">access modes</a>, this property
							takes into account any alternatives for content that is not broadly accessible, such as the
							inclusion of transcripts for audio content).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> MAY include additional
					[[schema-org]] accessibility metadata not specified in this section.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>This specification assumes that conformance and discoverability metadata will be processed and
						presented in a human-readable manner, removing the need for a summary unless there is additional
						information to express. Such processing is not available in all market segments, however,
						particularly in library systems. Publishers should consider this limitation when deciding
						whether to include a summary and what to state in it.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="note">

			<h2>Accessible publications</h2>

			<section id="sec-accessible-pubs-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>EPUB builds on the Open Web Platform, with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG the core technologies used
					for content authoring. Leveraging these technologies allows <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> to author <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> with a high degree
					of accessibility through the application of established web accessibility techniques, such as using
					native elements and controls whenever possible and enhancing custom interactive content with
					[[wai-aria]] roles, states, and properties. Plus, whenever possible, the EPUB community adds
					publishing accessibility needs to these standards &#8212; for example, through the creation of the
					[[dpub-aria-1.0]] role module. It is not necessary for anyone familiar with web accessibility to
					learn a new accessibility framework to make EPUB publications accessible.</p>

				<p>The primary source for producing accessible web content is the W3C's Web Content Accessibility
					Guidelines (WCAG) [[wcag2]], which establish benchmarks for accessible content. WCAG defines four
					high-level content principles â that content be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
					These principles are also central to creating accessible EPUB publications, so it is no surprise
					that this specification builds on the extensive work done in WCAG.</p>

				<p>This section defines <a href="#sec-acc-pub-wcag">how to apply the conformance criteria defined in
						WCAG</a> to EPUB publications. It also adds additional <a href="#sec-epub-req">requirements
						unique to EPUB publications</a>, and defines <a href="#sec-conf-reporting">conformance reporting
						requirements</a>.</p>

				<p>EPUB publications authored to comply with the requirements in this section will have a high degree of
					accessibility for users with a wide variety of reading needs and preferences.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-rel-wcag" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to WCAG</h3>

				<p>WCAG [[wcag2]] and its <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/">associated techniques</a>
					provide extensive coverage of issues and solutions for web content accessibility, covering
					everything from multimedia to interactive content to structured markup and more. They represent the
					foundation that this specification builds upon.</p>

				<p>This specification does not repeat the requirements or techniques introduced in those documents, as
					it risks breaking compatibility between the two standards (e.g., putting guidance out of sync, or in
					conflict). At the same time, although this specification does not call out those requirements, it
					does not diminish their importance in creating <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> that are
					accessible.</p>

				<p>This specification instead defines how to apply WCAG to an EPUB publication â which is a <a
						href="#sec-wcag-eval-page-pub">collection of web documents</a> as opposed to a single page â and
					adds an <a href="#sec-epub-req">additional set of requirements</a>. These requirements are no more
					or less important than those covered in WCAG; they are simply necessary to follow for EPUB
					publications. (Each requirement explains its relationship to WCAG in its respective section.)</p>

				<p>The same is true of the techniques in the EPUB Accessibility Techniques document
					[[epub-a11y-tech-11]]. It provides coverage of techniques that are unique to EPUB publications, or
					that need clarification in the context of an EPUB publication. It does not mean that the rest of the
					WCAG techniques are not applicable.</p>

				<p>As a result, although <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> can
					read this section without deep knowledge of WCAG conformance, to implement the accessibility
					requirements of this specification requires an understanding of WCAG.</p>

				<p>Because this specification adds requirements that are not a part of WCAG, an EPUB publication can
					conform to WCAG without conforming to this specification.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-acc-pub-wcag">
				<h3>WCAG conformance</h3>

				<section id="sec-wcag-conf">
					<h4>WCAG conformance requirements</h4>

					<p>To conform to this specification, an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication"
							>EPUB publication</a>:</p>

					<ul class="conformance-list">
						<li>
							<p id="confreq-wcag-20">MUST, at the minimum, meet the requirements of WCAG 2.0 [[wcag20]],
								but it is strongly recommended that it meet the requirements of the <a
									data-cite="wcag2#">latest recommended version of WCAG 2</a>.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p id="confreq-wcag-a">MUST, for whichever version of WCAG 2 selected, meet the requirements
								of Level A, but it is strongly recommended that it meet the requirements of Level
								AA.</p>
							<div class="note">
								<p>Although conforming at level AAA is not required by this specification, <a
										href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> are
									encouraged to follow the practices detailed in AAA success criteria when producing
									accessible EPUB publications.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The reporting flexibility offered by these requirements is to ensure that this specification can
						be adapted for use in regions that mandate accessibility but without negating or superseding the
						requirements in effect in those regions.</p>

					<p>This specification sets the baseline requirement to WCAG 2.0 Level A, for example, primarily to
						provide EPUB creators backwards compatibility for older content and flexibility to encourage
						adoption of accessible production where no formal requirements exist. Most accessibility
						practitioners do not recognize this level as providing a high degree of accessibility,
						however.</p>

					<p>Ideally, EPUB creators should try to conform to the latest version of WCAG 2 at Level AA, but
						local and national laws, or procurer or distributor requirements, will define the formal
						thresholds they must meet.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Examples of legislative requirements for accessibility include the <a
								href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">Directive
								2019/882</a> in the European Union and <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/"
								>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> in the United States. EPUB
							publications will need to meet more than just the basic Level A success criteria to be
							compliant with these laws.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Keeping pace with WCAG has the benefit of continuously enhancing access for users. As web
						technologies change and improve, and awareness of conditions that impede access evolve, the
						standard adds new requirements. Meeting these additional requirements helps ensure EPUB
						publications employ the most up-to-date techniques. Meeting the requirements of older versions,
						while still helpful, can result in a less optimal reading experience.</p>

					<p>Similarly, legal frameworks and policies often cite Level AA conformance as the benchmark for
						accessibility. The reason is that it provides the greatest range of improvements that EPUB
						creators can realistically implement. When EPUB creators meet only Level A conformance, they
						compromise their content for various user groups, resulting in a less optimal reading
						experience.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> is
							currently developing WCAG 3. As this version potentially represents a significant departure
							from WCAG 2, a future version of this specification will address conformance requirements
							related to it. EPUB creators are encouraged to adopt WCAG 3 once it is stable and widely
							recognized, but conformance to the new version is not a requirement of this standard.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-wcag-eval">
					<h4>Evaluating WCAG conformance</h4>

					<section id="sec-wcag-eval-page-pub">
						<h5>Page and publication</h5>

						<p>The WCAG <a data-cite="wcag2#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance">principles</a> [[wcag2]] focus on the
							evaluation of individual web pages, but an <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> more
							closely resembles what WCAG refers to as a <a data-cite="wcag2#dfn-set-of-web-pages">set of
								web pages</a>: "[a] collection of web pages that share a common purpose" [[wcag2]].</p>

						<p>Consequently, when evaluating the accessibility of an EPUB publication, <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> cannot review
							individual pages â or EPUB content documents, as they are known in EPUB 3 â in isolation.
							Rather, EPUB creators MUST evaluate their accessibility as part of the larger work.</p>

						<p>For example, it is not sufficient for EPUB creators to order the content within individual <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content documents</a>

								publication</a>, the WCAG <a data-cite="wcag2#conformance-reqs">conformance criteria</a>
							[[wcag2]] are applied as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>When determining compliance with a conformance level, the whole EPUB publication MUST
								meet the conformance requirements of the level claimed.</li>

							<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> MUST NOT use
								EPUB's fallback mechanisms to provide a <a
									data-cite="wcag2#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternate version</a>
								[[wcag2]], as there is no reliable way for users to access such fallbacks. If an EPUB
								creator uses fallbacks, both the primary content and its fallback(s) MUST meet the
								requirements for the conformance level claimed. EPUB-specific fallback mechanisms
								include <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-manifest-fallbacks">manifest
									fallbacks</a> [[epub-3]], <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-opf-bindings"

					<h4>Page navigation</h4>

					<section id="sec-page-nav-overview" class="informative">
						<h5>Overview</h5>

						<p>Statically paginated content is still ubiquitous, as print continues to be the most consumed
							medium for books both among the general reading public and in educational settings. Print is
							not the only source of static pagination, either: static page boundaries are also present in
							fixed-layout digital publications.</p>

						<p>As a result, non-visual readers face disadvantages relative to their peers in environments
							that use statically paginated content as they cannot easily locate the same locations in a
							publication (e.g., if a teacher instructs students to all turn to a specific page).</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page boundary locations helps bridge this disparity by ensuring the choice
							of reflowable media does not disadvantage those users.</p>

						<p>Providing page navigation also helps in reflowable publications that do not have a statically
							paginated equivalent. The default pagination of these publications by <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> is not
							static since it changes depending on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-viewport"
								>viewport</a> size and user's font settings. As a result, coordinating locations among
							users of the same <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
								publication</a> can be complicated without static references.</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page navigation represents one method of achieving the <a
								data-cite="wcag2#multiple-ways">Multiple Ways success criterion</a> [[wcag2]], as it
							provides another meaningful way for users to access the content (e.g., in addition to the
							table of contents, linear reading order and any other navigation aids).</p>

						<p>Given the importance of page navigation in mixed print/digital environments, the requirement
							to include this feature has higher precedence than it would solely as one of many ways to
							meet the Multiple Ways success criterion.</p>

							<li>the EPUB creator offers the EPUB publication as an alternative to a statically paginated
								publication in an environment where they can reasonably predict the use of both versions
								(e.g., educational settings); or</li>

							<li>the EPUB creator generates the EPUB publication and a statically paginated publication

					<h4>Synchronized text-audio playback</h4>

					<section id="sec-sync-overview" class="informative">
						<h5>Overview</h5>

						<p>The provision of synchronized text-audio playback helps address various user needs. It not
							only enables a seamless visual and auditory reading experience from beginning to end of an
								<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>, but is
							useful to users who only require audio playback (e.g., who cannot see the text or are
							prevented from reading visually due to motion-sickness) or who only benefit from reading
							with text highlighting (e.g., readers with dyslexia).</p>

						<p>Unlike purely linear listening experiences, EPUB with synchronized text-audio playback
							preserves the user's ability to navigate around the publication, such as via the table of
							contents, and also introduces audio-centric reading features like phrase navigation, and
							ways to control which parts of the content are read aloud.</p>

						<p>In order to offer users greater control over content presentation, <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> need to add
							structure and semantics so that the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> has the
							necessary context to enable this type of user experience. With greater context, a reading
							system can provide the ability to skip past secondary content that interferes with the
							primary narrative and escape users from deeply nested structures like tables.</p>

						<p>Adding structure and semantics to synchronized text-audio playback broadly falls under the
							objective of the <a data-cite="wcag2#info-and-relationships">Info and Relationships success
								criterion</a> [[wcag2]]. Without structured and semantically meaningful playback
							sequences, the effect is to deprive users of rich navigation of the content.</p>

									<p>Every <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
											publication</a> has a default reading order that allows users to progress
										through the content. The default reading order consists of two parts: the order
										of references in the spine provides a high-level progression through the <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
											documents</a> that make up the publication, while the markup within each
										EPUB content document provides the default progression through the content
										elements (i.e., as represented in the document object model [[dom]]).</p>
									<p>For many languages, the default reading order also matches the logical reading
										order &#8212; the way that users will naturally follow the narrative. It ensures
										that readers can follow the primary narrative and that they encounter secondary
										content where the author intended it to be read. The default reading order also
										establishes some less obvious relations, like the progress within a table from
										cell to cell and row to row.</p>
									<p>If the sequence of the synchronized text-audio playback does not match this
										progression, it can cause confusion for readers, whether they are only listening
										to the audio or trying to also follow visually.</p>
									<p>Ordering the playback to match the default reading order is the safest way to
										ensure that users can follow the text. In some cases, however, strict adherence
										to this practice can result in a suboptimal reading experience (e.g., playback
										of a table by column instead of row might make more natural sense in some
										cases). These publications have a logical reading order that cannot match the
										default order of the elements of the host format.</p>
									<p>The goal of this objective is not to forbid alternate presentations, but to

							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package document</a>.</p>

					<p>This metadata establishes both:</p>

					<p>The metadata uses a combination of properties from DCMI Metadata Terms [[dcterms]] and the <a

						following sections.</p>

					<p>Although any individual or party can perform a conformance evaluation &#8212; provided they have
						the knowledge and tools to assess EPUB publications against the <a href="#sec-wcag-conf"

						users need to be able to trust that evaluations are performed in a comprehensive manner and that
						conformance claims are not influenced by self-interest in the outcome.</p>

					<p>To address this confidence issue, some regions designate a local authority responsible for all
						evaluations, in which case there is no flexibility in who can perform evaluations. Where such
						authorities do not exist, evaluators are encouraged to obtain and reference any applicable <a
							href="#sec-evaluator-credentials">credentials</a> to strengthen public confidence in their

					<div class="note">
						<p>As each metadata format is unique in what it can express, this specification does not mandate

					<h4>Re-evaluating conformance</h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The following guidance is provided only to help <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> determine when a
							new evaluation is necessary. It is not a conformance requirement of this specification.</p>
					</div>

					<p>How long a conformance evaluation of an <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> is good for is
						a complex question. Unlike web sites, which are continuously evolving, EPUB creators may not
						update EPUB publications after their initial publication. As a result, an unmodified EPUB
						publication will always conform to its last evaluation.</p>

					<p>It is common in publishing, however, to release updated versions of an EPUB publication to fix
						errors and typos in the work, as well as to periodically release new editions. As not all
						changes to an EPUB publication substantively change its accessibility, this complicates the
						question of when EPUB creators should perform a new evaluation, as well as whether a full or
						partial re-evaluation will suffice.</p>

					<p>As a rule, EPUB creators must re-evaluate their content whenever they make substantive changes to
						the structure and functionality of an EPUB publication, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>modifications to the nature or order of markup in <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
							documents</a>;</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to images that convey information;</li>
						<li>modifications to formatting that affects the readability (e.g., contrast); and</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to interactive controls, forms, etc.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If the EPUB publication includes substantively the same markup and content as the previous
						release, the EPUB creator may only need to evaluate the new modifications to re-confirm
						conformance.</p>

					<p>If an updated version of this specification or [[wcag2]] has been published since the last
						release of the EPUB publication, however, this specification also recommends performing a new
						evaluation to ensure conformance to the latest standards. EPUB creators may not have to perform
						a full re-evaluation even in this case (i.e., they may only need to check new or modified
						success criteria unless the standards undergo major changes to methodology or conformance).</p>

					<p>Conversely, EPUB creators do not need to perform a re-evaluation when making non-substantive
						changes, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>fixes for typographic errors in the text (i.e., no markup is changed);</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to decorative images;</li>
						<li>modifications to the formatting that do not affect the understanding of the content or
							change the text display; and</li>
						<li>modifications to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">package
								document</a> metadata.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Individuals qualified to assess the accessibility of EPUB publications should make the
						determination of whether changes are substantive or not. An editor, for example, may not realize
						the impact of seemingly minor formatting changes.</p>

					<p>Even in the case of non-substantive changes, this specification recommends an updated evaluation
						(full or partial) if the accessibility standards have changed.</p>

					<p>EPUB creators should consider even more progressive approaches than those described here. Waiting
						for content changes before reviewing and updating the accessibility of EPUB publications can
						leave them lacking recent improvements. For example, a publisher might prioritize periodic
						reviews of their top-selling EPUB publications to ensure they remain maximally usable to the
						widest possible audience.</p>

			<h2>Optimized publications</h2>

			<p>Although WCAG [[wcag2]] provides a general set of guidelines for making content broadly accessible,
				conformant content is not always optimal for specific user groups. Conversely, content optimized for a
				specific need or reading modality is often not conformant to WCAG exactly because it targets a specific
				audience.</p>

			<p>For example, an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> with
				synchronized text and audio can contain a full audio recording of the content but limit the text content
				to only the major headings. In this case, the EPUB publication is consumable by users who needs to hear
				the content (i.e., they can listen to the full publication and can navigate between headings), but it is
				not usable by anyone who cannot hear the audio.</p>

			<p>In other words, when an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creator</a> optimizes
				an EPUB publication for a specific reading modality, the failure to achieve a WCAG conformance level
				does not make it any less accessible to the intended audience.</p>

			<p>Defining requirements for optimized publications is outside the scope of this specification, as is
				formally recognizing other standards and guidelines that address these specific needs. The general model
				of this specification can be used as a basis for identifying how an EPUB creator has optimized their
				content, however.</p>

			<p>In particular, if an EPUB publication meets the requirements of an optimization standard, the following
				best practices are recommended:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The EPUB publication should meet the <a href="#sec-discovery">discovery metadata requirements</a> of
					this specification so its accessible properties are machine-readable.</li>
				<li>The EPUB publication should identify the standard or guidelines it follows in a
						<code>conformsTo</code> property in accordance with [[dcterms]] so this information can be made
					available to users.</li>
				<li>If the standard does not define conformance values for the <code>conformsTo</code> property, EPUB
					creators should use a URL [[url]] to where the standard is publicly available so users can look up
					the specific details of the standard.</li>
				<li>If the identifier is not sufficient for a user to understand conformance (e.g., the guidelines are
					not publicly available), EPUB creators should provide additional information about they have
					optimized the content in the <a href="#confreq-schema-accessibilitySummary">accessibility
						summary</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>When creating guidelines for optimized EPUB publications, it is recommended that these practices be
				integrated as a formal requirement for conformance.</p>

			<h2>Distribution</h2>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Although <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> do not have to
					follow the recommendations in this section to conform to this specification, some jurisdictions
					require EPUB creators to follow similar practices. <a
						href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">Directive
						2019/882</a>, for example, includes similar requirements for digital publications distributed in
					the European Union.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The creation of accessible <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
					publications</a> does not guarantee that the publication will be obtainable or consumable by users
				in an accessible fashion. Depending on how EPUB creators distribute their EPUB publications, other
				factors will influence their overall accessibility. For example, an accessible interface for locating
				and obtaining content is an essential part of the distribution process, as is the ability to search and
				review accessibility metadata.</p>

			<p>While much of the distribution process is outside the control of EPUB creators, so outside the scope of
				this specification, there are factors an EPUB creator can control. For example, while an EPUB creator
				typically does not control the accessibility of the digital rights management (DRM) scheme applied to
				their EPUB publications, they do control what usage rights to apply to their EPUB publications. So even
				though a DRM scheme may allow an Author to block access to the text of the publication, the EPUB creator
				needs to take care not to apply such a restriction as it could block the ability for <a>assistive
					technologies</a> to read the text aloud.</p>

			<p>To minimize the effects of distribution on accessibility, this specification advises EPUB creators adhere
				to the following distribution practices:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>they must not impose restrictions that impair access by assistive technologies; and</li>
				<li>they must include accessibility metadata in the record format required for distribution of an EPUB
					publication (e.g., [[onix]] or [[marc21]]) when the format supports such metadata.</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="note">
				<p>A distributor may implement a digital rights management scheme that inherently impairs accessibility
					through no fault of the EPUB creator. Following the guidance in this section does not restrict EPUB
					creators from using such distributors. The intent is only that the EPUB creator not impair
					accessibility by activating a feature that would normally not be active.</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section id="privacy">
			<h2>Privacy and security</h2>

			<p>The authoring of accessible content does not introduce any new privacy or security considerations for
				users. Meeting accessibility requirements is about optimally using the available technologies, and no
				new features are introduced by this specification.</p>

			<p>The inclusion of accessibility metadata by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB
					creators</a> similarly does not introduce security or privacy issues for the EPUB creator, as
				describing an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> only
				provides a general idea of its suitability for different user groups.</p>

			<p>The use of accessibility metadata in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system"
					>reading systems</a>, bookstores and any other interface that can build a profile of the user, on
				the other hand, has the potential to violate the user's privacy. While it might seem helpful to store
				and anticipate the type of content a user is most likely to consume, for example, or how best to
				initiate its playback, developers should not engage in such profiling unless explicit permission is
				obtained from the user and a means of easily removing the profile is available.</p>

			<p>Even in the case where a user assents to the application maintaining information about their
				accessibility needs, developers SHOULD ensure that this information is kept private (e.g., not share the
				information with third party advertisers or even with the original publisher).</p>

			<p>Developers SHOULD NOT store or mine information about the types of searches a user performs when
				searching for content based on its accessibility characteristics. This information can be used to
				indirectly profile the abilities of users.</p>

							1455</a>.</li>
					<li>26-Mar-2021: Added non-normative section detailing when to re-evaluate EPUB publications. See <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1470">issue 1470</a>.</li>
