			<p>This specification specifies content conformance requirements for verifying the accessibility of EPUBÂ®

		</section>
		<section id="sotd">
			<div class="ednote">
				<p>Publishers not currently producing accessible content are encouraged to begin updating their
					production processes to meet the requirements of [[EPUB-A11Y-10]] while this specification is being
					developed. Content that meets the requirements of that version will typically also meet the
					requirements of this specification with few changes necessary.</p>
			</div>

		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>This specification, EPUB Accessibility, addresses two key needs in the EPUB ecosystem:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>discoverability of the accessible qualities of EPUB Publications; and</li>
					<li>evaluation and certification of accessible EPUB Publications.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The provision of accessibility metadata facilitates informed decisions about the usability of an EPUB
					Publication. Consumers can review the qualities of the content and decide whether an EPUB
					Publication is appropriate for their needs, regardless of whether it meets the bar of accessible
					certification. At a minimum, all EPUB Publications that conform to this specification meet the
					accessibility metadata requirements described in <a href="#sec-discovery"></a>.</p>

				<p>Although EPUB Creators have always been able to create EPUB Publications with a high degree of
					accessibility, this specification sets formal requirements for certifying content accessible. These
					requirements provide EPUB Creators a clear set of guidelines to evaluate their content against and
					allows certification of quality. An accessible EPUB Publication is one that meets the accessibility
					requirements described in <a href="#sec-accessible-pubs"></a>.</p>

				<p>The specification also discusses the practice of optimizing EPUB Publications for specific reading
					modalities. In these cases, the content cannot meet the broad accessibility requirements of this
					specification, but by following its discoverability and reporting requirements EPUB Creators can
					improve the ability of users to determine if the content still meets their needs. Refer to <a
						href="#sec-optimized-pubs"></a> for more information.</p>

				<p>The specification also addresses the impact of distribution on the accessibility and discoverability
					of content in <a href="#sec-distribution"></a>.</p>

				<p>This specification does not target a single version of EPUB. It is applicable to EPUB Publications
					that conform to any version or profile, including future versions of the standard.</p>

				<p>Ideally, these guidelines help evaluate any digital publication built on Open Web technologies,
					although ensuring such application is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For additional background on the decisions that went into this specification, refer to <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/docs/a11y-faq/">EPUB Accessibility Frequently Asked
							Questions</a>.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-success-techniques" class="informative">
				<h3>Success Techniques</h3>

				<p>This specification takes an abstract approach to the accessibility requirements for EPUB
					Publications, similar to how WCAG [[WCAG2]] separates its accessibility guidelines from the
					techniques to achieve them. This approach allows the guidelines to remain stable even as the format
					evolves.</p>

				<p>To facilitate this approach, the companion <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/">EPUB
						Accessibility Techniques</a> [[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]] document outlines conformance techniques.
					These techniques explain how to meet the requirements of this specification for different versions
					of EPUB.</p>

				<div class="ednote">
					<p>A task force of the EPUB 3 Working Group is currently producing <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/fxl-a11y/">techniques for accessible fixed
							layout publications</a>. When that document is formally published, it should be mentioned in
						this section.</p>
				</div>

				<section id="sec-sc-i18n">
					<h4>Internationalization</h4>

					<p>This specification is also designed to address the accessibility needs of users independent of
						what languages they read. The same is true for the principles and success criteria defined in
						[[WCAG2]]. The goal is to ensure that users can fully consume the information of a publication
						regardless of their preferred reading modality.</p>

					<p>At the same time, the language and writing conventions of the authored text will influence the
						techniques necessary to meet the accessibility requirements. EPUB <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#confreq-xml-enc">requires support for Unicode text</a>
						[[EPUB-3]], for example, which ensures the correct character data can be used (i.e., EPUB
						Creators do not have to use images of text). Although this is an important feature, it is often
						not enough on its own to ensure that the text is fully accessible in any given language (e.g.,
						additional information about directionality, emphasis, pronunciation, etc. may also be
						needed).</p>

					<p>As a consequence, there may be language- or culture-specific practices for meeting accessibility
						requirements. Whether these practices are defined within this specification and its techniques
						or elsewhere (e.g., in WCAG techniques or language-specific best practice recommendations) will
						depend on whether the issues are specific to EPUB or broadly affect all Web content.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-application" class="informative">
				<h3>Application to Older Versions</h3>

				<p>This specification is applicable to any EPUB Publication, even if the content conforms to an older
					version of EPUB that does not refer to this specification (e.g., EPUB 2 [[OPF-201]]).</p>

				<p>Creators of such EPUB Publications should create content in conformance with the accessibility and
					discoverability requirements of this specification. EPUB Creators should also upgrade to the latest
					version of EPUB to get access to the most advanced accessibility features and techniques.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This specification uses the following terminology defined in EPUB 3 [[EPUB-3]]:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB Content Document</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB Creator</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB Publication</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-media-overlay-document">Media Overlays Document</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-package-document">Package Document</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system">Reading System</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, it uses the definition of <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#dfn-assistive-technologies">assistive technology</a> as
					defined in [[WCAG2]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>An assistive technology is not always a separate application from a Reading System. Reading
						Systems often integrate features of standalone assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech
						playback.</p>

		<section id="sec-discovery">
			<h2>Discoverability</h2>

			<section id="sec-disc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>Unlike web pages, EPUB Creators distribute EPUB Publications through many channels for personal
					consumption â a model that has made EPUB a successful format for ebooks and other types of digital
					publications. A consequence of this model, however, is that specific details about the accessibility
					of a publication must travel with it.</p>

				<p>An online bookstore aggregating content from publishers and authors, for example, does not know the
					production quality that went into each submission unless the publisher informs them through
					metadata.</p>

				<p>Ensuring that any interested party can discover the accessible qualities of an EPUB Publication is
					therefore a primary concern. Users must be able to gauge the usability of an EPUB Publication when
					they purchase, borrow, or otherwise obtain it, a determination that requires knowing the affordances
					made to meet the accessibility requirements.</p>

				<p>Similarly, content that does not meet the accessibility requirements of this specification does not
					necessarily fail to meet the needs of individual users.</p>

				<p>Only through the provision of rich metadata can a user decide if the content is suitable for
					them.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-disc-package">
				<h3>Package Metadata</h3>

				<p>All EPUB Publications MUST include [[schema-org]] accessibility metadata in the Package Document that
					exposes their accessible properties, regardless of whether the publications also meet the <a
						href="#sec-accessible-pubs">accessibility</a> or <a href="#sec-optimized-pubs">optimization</a>
					requirements.</p>

				<p>EPUB Publications MUST include the following accessibility metadata:</p>

				<ul class="conformance-list">
					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessMode"><a href="https://schema.org/accessMode">accessMode</a> â a
							human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty necessary to process or perceive the
							content (e.g., textual, visual, auditory, tactile).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilityFeature"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"
								>accessibilityFeature</a> â features and adaptations that contribute to the overall
							accessibility of the content (e.g., alternative text, extended descriptions, captions).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilityHazard"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"
								>accessibilityHazard</a> â any potential hazards that the content presents (e.g.,
							flashing, motion simulation, sound).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessibilitySummary"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary"
								>accessibilitySummary</a> â a human-readable summary of the overall accessibility, which
							includes a description of any known deficiencies (e.g., lack of extended descriptions,
							specific hazards).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>EPUB Publications SHOULD include the following [[schema-org]] accessibility metadata:</p>

				<ul class="conformance-list">
					<li>
						<p id="confreq-schema-accessModeSufficient"><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"
								>accessModeSufficient</a> â a set of one or more access modes sufficient to consume the
							content without significant loss of information. An EPUB Publication can have more than one
							set of sufficient access modes for its consumption depending on the types of content it
							includes (i.e., unlike <a href="#confreq-schema-accessMode">access modes</a>, this property
							takes into account any affordances for content that is not broadly accessible, such as the
							inclusion of transcripts for audio content).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>EPUB Creators MAY include additional [[schema-org]] accessibility metadata not specified in this
					section.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/#sec-discovery">Discovery Metadata
							Techniques</a> [[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]] for more information on these properties and how to
						include them in different versions of EPUB. See also <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/#dist-002">DIST-002: Include accessibility

						accessibility metadata in other formats.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-disc-linked-rec">
				<h3>Linked Metadata Records</h3>

				<p>Accessibility metadata can also be included in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-link-elem"
						>linked records</a> [[EPUB-3]] (i.e., metadata records referenced from <code>link</code>
					elements), but the inclusion of such metadata solely in a linked record does not satisfy the
					discoverability requirements of this specification.</p>

			<h2>Accessible Publications</h2>

			<section id="sec-accessible-pubs-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>EPUB builds on the Open Web Platform, with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG, the core technologies used
					for content authoring. The use of these technologies means that EPUB Creators can author EPUB
					Publications with a high degree of accessibility simply through the proper application of
					established web accessibility techniques.</p>

				<p>The primary source producing accessible web content is the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
					(WCAG) [[WCAG2]]. This specification leverages the extensive work done in WCAG to establish
					benchmarks for accessible content, and the same four high-level content principles â perceivable,
					operable, understandable, and robust â are central to creating EPUB Publications that are
					accessible.</p>

				<p>This section defines how to apply the conformance criteria defined in WCAG and addresses qualities
					unique to EPUB Publications.</p>

				<p>EPUB Publications authored to comply with the requirements in this section will have a high degree of
					accessibility for users with a wide variety of reading needs and preferences.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-rel-wcag" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to WCAG</h3>

				<p>WCAG [[WCAG2]] and its <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/">associated techniques</a>
					provide extensive coverage of issues and solutions for web content accessibility â from tables to
					embedded multimedia to rich semantics. They represent the foundation that this specification builds
					upon.</p>

				<p>This specification does not repeat the requirements or techniques introduced in those documents, as
					it risks breaking compatibility between the two standards (e.g., putting guidance out of sync, or in
					conflict). At the same time, although this specification does not call out those requirements, it
					does not diminish their importance in creating EPUB Publications that are accessible.</p>

				<p>This specification instead defines how to apply WCAG to an EPUB Publication â which is a <a
						href="#sec-wcag-eval-page-pub">collection of web documents</a> as opposed to a single page â and
					adds an <a href="#sec-epub-req">additional set of requirements</a>. These requirements are no more
					or less important than those covered in WCAG; they are simply necessary to follow for EPUB
					Publications. (Each requirement explains its relationship to WCAG in its respective section.)</p>

				<p>The same is true of the techniques in the EPUB Accessibility Techniques document
					[[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]]. It provides coverage of techniques that are unique to EPUB Publications, or
					that need clarification in the context of an EPUB Publication. It does not mean that the rest of the
					WCAG techniques are not applicable.</p>

				<p>As a result, although EPUB Creators can read this section without deep knowledge of WCAG conformance,
					to implement the accessibility requirements of this specification requires an understanding of
					WCAG.</p>

				<p>Because this specification adds requirements that are not a part of WCAG, an EPUB Publication can
					conform to WCAG without conforming to this specification.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-acc-pub-wcag">
				<h3>WCAG Conformance</h3>

				<section id="sec-wcag-conf">
					<h4>WCAG Conformance Requirements</h4>

					<p>To conform to this specification, an EPUB Publication:</p>

					<ul class="conformance-list">
						<li>
							<p id="confreq-wcag-20">MUST meet the requirements of WCAG 2.0 [[WCAG20]], but it is
								strongly RECOMMENDED that it meet the requirements of the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/">latest recommended version of WCAG 2</a>.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p id="confreq-wcag-a">MUST meet the requirements of <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc1">Level A</a>, but it is strongly RECOMMENDED
								that it meet the requirements of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc1">Level AA</a>
								[[WCAG2]].</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The reporting flexibility offered by these requirements is to ensure that this specification can
						be adapted for use in regions that mandate accessibility but without negating or superseding the
						requirements in effect in those regions.</p>

					<p>This specification sets the baseline requirement to WCAG 2.0 Level A, for example, primarily to
						provide EPUB Creators backwards compatibility for older content and flexibility to encourage
						adoption of accessible production where no formal requirements exist. Most accessibility
						practitioners do not recognize this level as providing a high degree of accessibility,
						however.</p>

					<p>Ideally, EPUB Creators should try to conform to the latest version of WCAG 2 at Level AA, but
						local and national laws, or procurer or distributor requirements, will define the formal
						thresholds they must meet.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Examples of legislative requirements for accessibility include the <a
								href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">Directive
								2019/882</a> in the European Union and <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/"
								>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> in the United States. EPUB
							Publications will need to meet more than just the basic Level A success criteria to be
							compliant with these laws.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Keeping pace with WCAG has the benefit of continuously enhancing access for users. As web
						technologies change and improve, and awareness of conditions that impede access evolve, the
						standard adds new requirements. Meeting these additional requirements helps ensure EPUB
						Publications employ the most up-to-date techniques. Meeting the requirements of older versions,
						while still helpful, can result in a less optimal reading experience.</p>

					<p>Similarly, legal frameworks and policies often cite Level AA conformance as the benchmark for
						accessibility. The reason is that it provides the greatest range of improvements that EPUB
						Creators can realistically implement (EPUB Creators should try to meet the AAA requirements if
						they can, but fully conforming at AAA is typically not possible). When EPUB Creators meet only
						Level A conformance, they compromise their content for various user groups, resulting in a less
						optimal reading experience.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> is
							currently developing WCAG 3. As this version potentially represents a significant departure
							from WCAG 2, a future version of this specification will address conformance requirements
							related to it. EPUB Creators are encouraged to adopt WCAG 3 once it is stable and widely
							recognized, but conformance to the new version is not a requirement of this standard.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-wcag-eval">
					<h4>Evaluating WCAG Conformance</h4>

					<section id="sec-wcag-eval-page-pub">
						<h5>Page and Publication</h5>

						<p>The WCAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance">principles</a>
							[[WCAG2]] focus on the evaluation of individual web pages, but an EPUB Publication more
							closely resembles what WCAG refers to as a <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#dfn-set-of-web-pages">set of web pages</a>: "[a]
							collection of Web pages that share a common purpose" [[WCAG2]].</p>

						<p>Consequently, when evaluating the accessibility of an EPUB Publication, EPUB Creators cannot
							review individual pages â or Content Documents, as they are known in EPUB 3 â in isolation.
							Rather, EPUB Creators MUST evaluate their accessibility as part of the larger work.</p>

						<p>For example, it is not sufficient for EPUB Creators to give individual EPUB Content Documents
							a logical reading order if they list the documents in the wrong reading order. Likewise,
							including a title for every EPUB Content Document is complementary to providing a title for
							the publication: the overall accessibility decreases if either is missing.</p>

						<p>EPUB Creators MUST evaluate the WCAG guidelines for content to be perceivable, operable,
							understandable, and robust against the full EPUB Publication, not only against each Content
							Document within it.</p>

						<p>The EPUB Accessibility Techniques [[?EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]] provide more information about
							applying these guidelines to EPUB Publications.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-wcag-application">
						<h5>Applying the Conformance Criteria</h5>

						<p>When evaluating an EPUB Publication, the WCAG <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#conformance-reqs">conformance criteria</a> [[WCAG2]]
							are applied as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>When determining compliance with a conformance level, the whole EPUB Publication MUST
								meet the conformance requirements of the level claimed.</li>

							<li>EPUB Creators MUST NOT use EPUB's fallback mechanisms to provide a <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming
									alternate version</a> [[WCAG2]], as there is no reliable way for users to access
								such fallbacks. If an EPUB Creator uses fallbacks, both the primary content and its
								fallback(s) MUST meet the requirements for the conformance level claimed. EPUB-specific
								fallback mechanisms include <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-foreign-restrictions-manifest">manifest
									fallbacks</a> [[EPUB-3]], <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-opf-bindings"
									>bindings</a> [[EPUB-3]] and content switching via the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-xhtml-content-switch"><code>epub:switch</code>
									element</a> [[EPUB-3]].</li>

							<li>When determining compliance with the "<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc2">Full
									Pages</a>" requirement [[WCAG2]] (i.e., that parts of a page cannot be excluded when
								making a conformance claim), the entirety of each EPUB Content Document MUST achieve the
								conformance level <em>and</em> every Content Document in the EPUB Publication MUST meet
								the stated conformance level.</li>
						</ul>

				<h3>EPUB Requirements</h3>

				<section id="sec-page-nav">
					<h4>Page Navigation</h4>

					<section id="sec-page-nav-overview" class="informative">
						<h5>Overview</h5>

						<p>Statically paginated content is still ubiquitous, as print continues to be the most consumed
							medium for books both among the general reading public and in educational settings. Print is
							not the only source of static pagination, either: static page boundaries are also present in
							fixed-layout digital publications.</p>

						<p>As a result, non-visual readers face disadvantages relative to their peers in environments
							that use statically paginated content as they cannot easily locate the same locations in a
							publication (e.g., if a teacher instructs students to all turn to a specific page).</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page boundary locations helps bridge this disparity by ensuring the choice
							of reflowable media does not disadvantage those users.</p>

						<p>Providing page navigation also helps in reflowable publications that do not have a statically
							paginated equivalent. The default pagination of these publications by Reading Systems is not
							static since it changes depending on the viewport size and user's font settings. As a
							result, coordinating locations among users of the same EPUB Publication can be complicated
							without static references.</p>

						<p>The inclusion of page navigation represents one method of achieving the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#multiple-ways">Multiple Ways success criterion</a>
							[[WCAG2]], as it provides another meaningful way for users to access the content (e.g., in
							addition to the table of contents, linear reading order and any other navigation aids).</p>

						<p>Given the importance of page navigation in mixed print/digital environments, the requirement
							to include this feature has higher precedence than it would solely as one of many ways to
							meet the Multiple Ways success criterion.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-tech-11/#sec-epub-page-markers">Page
									Markers</a> [[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]] for more information on the inclusion of page
								navigation in EPUB Publications.</p>

					<h4>Media Overlays Playback</h4>

					<section id="sec-mo-overview" class="informative">
						<h5>Overview</h5>

						<p>Media Overlays provide an accessible playback experience for anyone who benefits from having
							text and audio synchronized. They are also useful to users who only require audio playback,
							or only benefit from reading with text highlighting. Media Overlays also enable a seamless
							playback experience from beginning to end of an EPUB Publication for all these users.</p>

						<p>The most basic <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-overlays-def">Media Overlay
								Documents</a> [[EPUB-3]] provide only minimal instructions to Reading Systems, however.
							They indicate the text to highlight and the audio clip that corresponds to the text. The
							result is that users only have basic start and stop options available.</p>

						<p>EPUB Creators need to add structure and semantics to Media Overlay Documents to allow Reading
							Systems to present more usable experiences. With richer markup, a Reading System could
							provide the ability to skip past secondary content that interferes with the primary
							narrative, escape users from deeply nested structures like tables, and allow them to
							navigate through the sections of the publication without having to go to the table of
							contents.</p>

						<p>Adding structure and semantics to Media Overlay Documents broadly falls under the objective
							of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#info-and-relationships">Info and Relationships
								success criterion</a> [[WCAG2]]. Without structured and semantically meaningful playback
							sequences, the effect is to deprive users of rich navigation of the content.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-mo-applicability">
						<h5>Applicability</h5>

						<p>Media Overlay Documents MUST meet the requirements in [[EPUB-3]]. It is not necessary to meet
							any additional requirements beyond those defined in [[EPUB-3]] to be conformant with this
							specification.</p>

									<p>Although it is possible for users who require a publication in audio form to use

										encounter. As a result users have to have words repeated and spelled out to make
										sense of the content, slowing down their reading and reducing comprehension.</p>
									<p>For this reason, it is important to provide narration for the full text of a

									<p>If the sequence of <code>par</code> and <code>seq</code> elements in a Media
										Overlay Documents does not match this progression, it can cause confusion for
										readers, whether they are only listening to the audio or trying to also follow
										visually.</p>
									<p>Ordering the playback to match the default reading order is the safest way to
										ensure that users can follow the text. In some cases, however, strict adherence
										to this practice could result in a suboptimal reading experience (e.g., playback
										of a table by column instead of row might make more logical sense in some
										cases). The goal of this objective is not to forbid alternate presentations, but

					<h4>Re-Evaluating Conformance</h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The following guidance is to help EPUB Creators determine when a new evaluation is necessary.
							It is not a requirement to conform to this specification.</p>
					</div>

					<p>How long a conformance evaluation of an EPUB Publication is good for is a complex question.
						Unlike web sites, which are continuously evolving, EPUB Creators may not update EPUB
						Publications after their initial publication. As a result, an unmodified EPUB Publication will
						always conform to its last evaluation.</p>

					<p>It is common in publishing, however, to release updated versions of an EPUB Publication to fix
						errors and typos in the work, as well as to periodically release new editions. As not all
						changes to an EPUB Publication substantively change its accessibility, this complicates the
						question of when EPUB Creators should perform a new evaluation, as well as whether a full or
						partial re-evaluation will suffice.</p>

					<p>As a rule, EPUB Creators must re-evaluate their content whenever they make substantive changes to
						the structure and functionality of an EPUB Publication, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>modifications to the nature or order of markup in EPUB Content Documents;</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to images that convey information;</li>
						<li>modifications to formatting that affects the readability (e.g., contrast); and</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to interactive controls, forms, etc.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If the EPUB Publication includes substantively the same markup and content as the previous
						release, the EPUB Creator may only need to evaluate the new modifications to re-confirm
						conformance.</p>

					<p>If an updated version of this specification or [[WCAG]] has been published since the last release
						of the EPUB Publication, however, this specification also recommends performing a new evaluation
						to ensure conformance to the latest standards. EPUB Creators may not have to perform a full
						re-evaluation even in this case (i.e., they may only need to check new or modified success
						criteria unless the standards undergo major changes to methodology or conformance).</p>

					<p>Conversely, EPUB Creators do not need to perform a re-evaluation when making non-substantive
						changes, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>fixes for typographic errors in the text (i.e., no markup is changed);</li>
						<li>additions or modifications to decorative images;</li>
						<li>modifications to the formatting that do not affect the understanding of the content or
							change the text display; and</li>
						<li>modifications to Package Document metadata.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Individuals qualified to assess the accessibility of EPUB Publications should make the
						determination of whether changes are substantive or not. An editor, for example, may not realize
						the impact of seemingly minor formatting changes.</p>

					<p>Even in the case of non-substantive changes, this specification recommends an updated evaluation
						(full or partial) if the accessibility standards have changed.</p>

					<p>EPUB Creators should consider even more progressive approaches than those described here. Waiting
						for content changes before reviewing and updating the accessibility of EPUB Publications can
						leave them lacking recent improvements. For example, a publisher might prioritize periodic
						reviews of their top-selling EPUB Publications to ensure they remain maximally usable to the
						widest possible audience.</p>

			<h2>Optimized Publications</h2>

			<p>Although WCAG [[WCAG2]] provides a general set of guidelines for making content broadly accessible,
				conformant content is not always optimal for specific user groups. Conversely, content optimized for a
				specific need or reading modality is often not conformant to WCAG exactly because it targets a specific
				audience.</p>

			<p>For example, an EPUB Publication with synchronized text and audio can contain a full audio recording of
				the content but limit the text content to only the major headings. In this case, the EPUB Publication is
				consumable by users who needs to hear the content (i.e., they can listen to the full publication and can
				navigate between headings), but it is not usable by anyone who cannot hear the audio.</p>

			<p>In other words, when EPUB Creators optimize an EPUB Publication for specific reading modalities, the
				failure to achieve a WCAG conformance level does not make it any less accessible to the intended
				audience.</p>

			<p>Defining requirements for optimized publications is outside the scope of this specification, as is
				formally recognizing other standards and guidelines that address these specific needs. The general model
				of this specification can be used as a basis for identifying how an EPUB Creator has optimized their
				content, however.</p>

			<p>In particular, if an EPUB Publication meets the requirements of an optimization standard, the following
				best practices are recommended:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The EPUB Publication should meet the <a href="#sec-discovery">discovery metadata requirements</a> of
					this specification so its accessible properties are machine-readable.</li>
				<li>The EPUB Publication should identify the standard or guidelines it follows in a
						<code>conformsTo</code> property in accordance with [[DCTERMS]] so this information can be made
					available to users.</li>
				<li>If the standard does not define conformance values for the <code>conformsTo</code> property, EPUB
					Creators should use a URL [[URL]] to where the standard is publicly available so users can look up
					the specific details of the standard.</li>
				<li>If the identifier is not sufficient for a user to understand conformance (e.g., the guidelines are
					not publicly available), EPUB Creators should provide additional information about they have
					optimized the content in the <a href="#confreq-schema-accessibilitySummary">accessibility
						summary</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>When creating guidelines for optimized EPUB Publications, it is recommended that these practices be
				integrated as a formal requirement for conformance.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Refer to the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/docs/optimized-pubs/">Guide to Optimized
						Publication Standards</a> for an informative list of standards.</p>

			<h2>Distribution</h2>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Although EPUB Creators do not have to follow the recommendations in this section to conform to this
					specification, some jurisdictions require EPUB Creators to follow similar practices. <a
						href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">Directive
						2019/882</a>, for example, includes similar requirements for digital publications distributed in
					the European Union.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The creation of accessible EPUB Publications does not guarantee that the publication will be obtainable
				or consumable by users in an accessible fashion. Depending on how EPUB Creators distribute their EPUB
				Publications, other factors will influence their overall accessibility. For example, an accessible
				interface for locating and obtaining content is an essential part of the distribution process, as is the
				ability to search and review accessibility metadata.</p>

			<p>While much of the distribution process is outside the control of EPUB Creators, so outside the scope of
				this specification, there are factors an EPUB Creator can control. For example, while an EPUB Creator
				typically does not control the accessibility of the digital rights management (DRM) scheme applied to
				their EPUB Publications, they do control what usage rights to apply to their EPUB Publications. So even
				though a DRM scheme may allow an Author to block access to the text of the publication, the EPUB Creator
				needs to take care not to apply such a restriction as it could block the ability for assistive
				technologies to read the text aloud.</p>

			<p>To minimize the effects of distribution on accessibility, this specification advises EPUB Creators adhere
				to the following distribution practices:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>they must not impose restrictions that impair access by assistive technologies; and</li>
				<li>they must include accessibility metadata in the record format required for distribution of an EPUB
					Publication (e.g., [[ONIX]] or [[MARC21]]) when the format supports such metadata.</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="note">
				<p>A distributor may implement a digital rights management scheme that inherently impairs accessibility
					through no fault of the EPUB Creator. Following the guidance in this section does not restrict EPUB
					Creators from using such distributors. The intent is only that the EPUB Creator not impair
					accessibility by activating a feature that would normally not be active.</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section id="privacy" class="informative">
			<h2>Privacy and Security</h2>

			<p>The authoring of accessible content does not introduce any new privacy or security considerations for
				users. Meeting accessibility requirements is about optimally using the available technologies, and no
				new features are introduced by this specification.</p>

			<p>The inclusion of accessibility metadata by EPUB Creators similarly does not introduce security or privacy
				issues for the EPUB Creator, as describing an EPUB Publication only provides a general idea of its
				suitability for different user groups.</p>

			<p>The use of accessibility metadata in reading systems, bookstores and any other interface that can build a
				profile of the user, on the other hand, has the potential to violate individual privacy laws. While it
				might seem helpful to store and anticipate the type of content a user is most likely to consume, for
				example, or how best to initiate its playback, developers should not engage in such profiling unless
				explicit permission is obtained from the user and a means of easily removing the profile is
				available.</p>

			<p>Even in the case where a user assents to the application maintaining information about their
				accessibility needs, developers must ensure that this information is kept private (e.g., it must not be
				shared with third party advertisers or even with the original publisher).</p>

			<p>Developers should also be mindful about storing or mining information about the types of searches a user
				performs when searching for content based on its accessibility characteristics. This information can be
				used to indirectly profile the abilities of users.</p>
