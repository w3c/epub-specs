			<p>EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB
				format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced
				web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
				container.</p>

			<p>This overview provides a general starting point for anyone curious to understand the features available
				in EPUB 3 publications. It is not intended as a technical introduction to the format or to building
				reading systems.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="reading-overview">
				<h3>Reading this document</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3 format offers publishers the ability to create advanced reading experiences by leveraging
					the features and functionality of the Open Web Platform. The ability to use HTML, SVG, CSS, and
					JavaScript enables not only rich and interactive reading experiences but allows content to be
					produced for languages regardless of their default horizontal or vertical writing directions. The
					choice of these technologies also allows [=EPUB publications=] to be accessibly produced for a wide
					range of user needs.</p>

				<p>This overview explores, at a high level, the authoring features of EPUB 3 that provide this
					functionality. This document is not intended as a tutorial on creating EPUB publications and does
					not delve into the technical details of the format or how reading systems operate. Rather, it is
					intended for a more general audience seeking to understand the benefits of creating their digital
					publications using the EPUB 3 format without having to read through technical specifications.</p>

				<p>Before jumping straight into the features, however, it is helpful to have a basic conceptual
					understanding of how an EPUB publication is constructed. An EPUB file is effectively just a ZIP file
					with some identifying metadata that allows reading systems to recognize and render the publication
					inside (the ZIP file is formally called the [=EPUB container=] in the specifications).</p>

				<p>One of the key files in this rendering process is called the [=package document=]. It provides the
					metadata about the publication, lists all of the resources, and specifies the order in which to
					present the [=EPUB content documents=] (i.e., the XHTML and SVG documents that, when rendered,
					provide the content).</p>

				<p>The other key file is the [=EPUB navigation document=]. This document includes the table of contents
					for the publication as well as any other navigation aids the publisher has defined (e.g., a page
					list or list of landmarks).</p>

				<p id="fig-epub-structure">The following figure visually represents the structure of an EPUB
					publication:</p>

				<img src="images/epub.svg" width="600" aria-details="fig-epub-structure-diagram"
					alt="Visual structure of the main constituents of an EPUB publication" />

				<details id="fig-epub-structure-diagram" class="desc">
					<summary style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Image description</summary>
					<p>'EPUB (OCF) container' as the outer most component which encapsulates the 'EPUB publication'
						containing two documents 'Publication Document' and 'EPUB navigation document' along with a
						inner component labelled 'publication resources' which contains multiple 'EPUB content
						documents' (XHTML, SVG), and multiple 'Other resources' (CSS, png, mp3, mov, etc.). </p>
				</details>

				<p>The body of this document explores these resources in greater detail with the goal of providing
					greater insight into the array of features they enable in EPUB 3 publications.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="reading-specs">
				<h3>Reading the specifications</h3>

				<p>For those interested in going beyond the general introduction presented in this document, the EPUB
					3.3 specification [[epub-33]] contains all the essential authoring information.</p>

				<p>Prior to EPUB 3.3, reading the EPUB 3 specifications could be challenging. The format was split
					across multiple documents, and each document interspersed authoring and [=reading system=]
					requirements. With the release of EPUB 3.3, however, there is now only one the document to read.</p>

				<p>In addition, accessibility requirements for [=EPUB publications=] are described in the EPUB
					Accessibility specification [[epub-a11y-11]]. One of the great advantages of a digital format like
					EPUB 3 is that it breaks down the accessibility barriers of static print content. When constructed
					with accessibility in mind, publications are usable by users with diverse needs.</p>

				<p>While reading the Reading Systems specification [[epub-rs-33]] can help understand how content gets
					rendered, the technical details of this process are not necessary for authoring content.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For a list of all the recommendation-track EPUB 3 specifications and non-normative notes, refer
						to <a href="#app-documents"></a>.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="version-num">
				<h3>Version numbering</h3>

				<p>An initial point of confusion for people new to EPUB is the difference between "EPUB 3" the format
					and the EPUB 3 specification numbering. The current version of EPUB 3 is defined in the EPUB 3.3
					specification [[epub-33]]. The minor number attached to the specification (".3") differentiates one
					release of the specification from the next, but each new release does not represent a new
					format.</p>

				<p>The W3C working group that maintains EPUB 3 strives not to invalidate content produced to earlier
					versions of the specification, so an EPUB 3 publication produced to the EPUB 3.0 specification, for
					example, should also be valid to the EPUB 3.3 requirements.</p>

				<p>That is also why this overview is for "EPUB 3", as it typically does not change significantly from
					one specification release to the next.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For a general overview of the changes made in each revision, refer to <a
							href="#app-revision-history"></a>.</p>

		<section id="sec-container">
			<h2>The EPUB container</h2>

			<p>An [=EPUB publication=] is transported and interchanged as a single file (a "portable document") that
				contains the [=package document | package document(s)=], the [=EPUB content documents=], and all other
				required resources for processing the publication. The single-file container format for EPUB is based on
				the widely adopted ZIP format, and an XML document that identifies the location of the package document
				for the publication in the ZIP archive is located at a pre-defined location within the archive.</p>

			<p>This approach provides a clear contract between any creator of an EPUB publication and any system which
				consumes such EPUB publications, as well as a reliable representation that is independent of network
				transport or file system specifics.</p>

			<p>It also ensures that EPUB publications are creatable and editable using widely available ZIP tools.
				Publishers have the flexibility to use either commercially available editing applications or build their
				own content transformation pipelines.</p>

			<p>For more information about an EPUB publication's representation as a container file, refer to <a
					data-cite="epub-33#sec-ocf">Open Container Format (OFC)</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

		</section>
		<section id="sec-package-file">
			<h2>The package document</h2>

			<p>Every [=EPUB publication=] is represented by a [=package document=]. The package document specifies all
				the resources required to render that representation of the content. The package document also defines a
				reading order for linear consumption, and associates metadata and navigation information.</p>

			<p>The package document defines a layer on top of the traditional structuring of a typical web site to
				facilitate the authoring of digital publications. A web site, for example, embeds references to its
				resources within its content, which, while a simple and flexible means of identifying resources, makes
				it difficult to enumerate all the resources required to render it. In addition, there is no standard way
				for a web site to define that a sequence of pages make up a larger publication, which is precisely what
				EPUB's [^spine^] element [[epub-33]] does (i.e., it provides an external declarative means to explicitly
				specify navigation through a collection of documents).</p>

			<p data-cite="epub-33">The package document also provides a standard way to represent metadata globally
				applicable to the content. Each package document includes a <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-pkg-metadata"
					>metadata section</a> [[epub-33]] for general information about the EPUB publication, allowing
				titles, authors, identifiers, and other information to be easily accessed and presented to users. It
				also provides the means to attach complete bibliographic records using the [^link^] element
				[[epub-33]].</p>

			<p>The package document also allows a [=unique identifier=] to be established for the EPUB publication using
				the <a data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-package-unique-identifier"><code>unique-identifier</code>
					attribute</a> [[epub-33]]. This identifier provides a way for publishers to differentiate one
				publication from another, and even one edition from another.</p>

			<p>For more information about the package document, refer to <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">Package
					document</a> [[epub-33]].</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-nav">
			<h2>Navigation</h2>

			<section id="sec-nav-order">
				<h3>Reading order</h3>

				<p>A key concept of EPUB is that an [=EPUB publication=] consists of multiple resources that can be
					completely navigated and consumed by a person or program <em>in some specific order</em>.</p>

				<p>Many types of publication have an obvious reading order, or logical progression through their
					content. A novel is an example of a highly sequential document — it typically has a beginning,
					middle, and end — but not all publications are so ordered: a cookbook or a collection of
					photographic images is more like a database. All documents do, however, have at least one logical
					ordering of all their top-level content items, whether by date, topic, location, or some other
					criteria (e.g., a cookbook is typically arranged by recipe type).</p>

				<p>Each EPUB publication defines at least one such logical ordering of all its top-level content in the
					[=EPUB spine | spine=]. Each also defines a declarative table of contents in the <a
						href="#sec-nav-nav-doc">EPUB navigation document</a> [[epub-33]]. EPUB publications make these
					data structures available in a machine-readable way <em>external</em> to the content, simplifying
					their discovery and use.</p>

				<p>EPUB publications are not limited to the linear ordering of their contents, nor do they preclude
					linking in arbitrary ways — just like the web, EPUB publications are built on hypertext — but the
					basic consumption and navigation can be reliably accomplished in a way that is not true for a set of
					HTML pages.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-nav-nav-doc">
				<h3>Navigation document</h3>

				<p>Each [=EPUB publication=] contains a special [=XHTML content document=] called the [=EPUB navigation
					document=]. This document uses the [[html]] [^nav^] element to define human- and machine-readable
					navigation information. All [=reading systems=] make use of the EPUB navigation document to present
					a table of contents to their users.</p>

				<p>The EPUB navigation document provides baseline accessibility and navigation support and offers
					features to enhance navigation for all users. Prime among these are support for internationalization
					(for example, as an XHTML document itself, the EPUB navigation document natively supports <a
						data-lt="ruby">ruby annotations</a>) and support for embedded grammars (MathML and SVG can be
					included within navigation links).</p>

				<p>Although EPUB reading systems are not required to support these advanced text formatting features
					when they process the data to create their own table of contents, the dual role of the EPUB
					navigation document means the features can still be useful for their intended audience. Publishers
					can include the EPUB navigation document in the [=EPUB spine | spine=] [[epub-33]] (i.e., as a page
					of content in the publication) so that users have direct access to the full HTML.</p>

				<p>Including the EPUB navigation document in the body of an EPUB publication also allows publishers
					tailor the display differently for users and reading systems. In highly structured documents, for
					example, it might not be desirable to display the complete table of contents to users in the body of
					the publication. In this case, the display level can be modified using the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav-doc-use-spine"><code>hidden</code> attribute</a> [[epub-33]]. This
					attribute is ignored by reading systems when they render the table of contents outside the [=EPUB
					spine | spine=] (e.g., in their own specialized views), which avoids minimizing the information that
					is available and improves the overall accessibility.</p>

				<p>Publishers can also supply additional [^nav^] elements if their EPUB publications contain
					non-structural points of interest, such as to page breaks, landmarks, figures, tables, etc., to
					further enhance access to the content.</p>

				<p>For more information about the structure and semantics of EPUB navigation documents, refer to <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">EPUB navigation document</a> [[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-content-docs">
			<h2>Content documents</h2>

			<p>Each [=EPUB publication=] contains one or more [=EPUB content documents=], as defined in <a
					data-cite="epub-33#sec-contentdocs">EPUB content documents</a> [[epub-33]]. These are XHTML or SVG
				documents that describe the readable content and reference associated media resources (e.g., images,
				audio, and video clips).</p>

			<p>[=XHTML content documents=] are defined by a profile of [[html]].</p>

			<section id="sec-rendering">
				<h2>Rendering and CSS</h2>

				<p>A key concept of EPUB is that content presentation adapts to the user, rather than the user having to
					adapt to a particular presentation of content. HTML was originally designed to support dynamic
					rendering of structured content, but over time HTML as supported in web browsers has become focused
					on the needs of web applications, and many popular web sites now have layouts with less
					flexibility.</p>

				<p>[=EPUB publications=], however, are designed to maximize accessibility for the visually impaired, and
					[=reading systems=] typically perform text line layout and pagination on the fly, adapting to the
					size of the display area, the user's preferred font size, and other environmental factors. This
					behavior is not guaranteed in EPUB; images, vector graphics, video, and other non-reflowable content
					might be included, and some reading systems might not paginate on the fly, or at all. Nevertheless,
					supporting dynamic adaptive layout and accessibility has been a primary design consideration
					throughout the evolution of the EPUB standard.</p>

				<p>EPUB content documents can reference CSS style sheets, allowing publishers to define the desired
					rendering properties. EPUB 3 follows support for CSS as defined in the [[csssnapshot]].</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also supports CSS styles that enable both horizontal and vertical layout and both
					left-to-right and right-to-left writing.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-multimedia">
				<h2>Multimedia</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports the embedding of audio and video in [=XHTML content documents=] via the [[html]]
						<span data-cite="html">[^audio^] and [^video^]</span> elements, inheriting all the functionality
					and features these elements provide (e.g., built-in start, stop, and volume controls). For more
					information on the audio and video formats EPUB 3 supports, refer to the section on <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-core-media-types">core media types</a> [[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-fonts">
				<h2>Fonts</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports two closely related font formats — OpenType [[opentype]] and WOFF [[woff]]
					[[woff2]] — to accommodate both traditional publishing workflows and emerging web-based workflows.
					Word processing programs used to create [=EPUB publications=] are likely to have access only to a
					collection of installed OpenType fonts, for example, whereas web-archival EPUB generators will
					likely only have access to WOFF resources (which cannot be converted to OpenType without
					undesirable, and potentially unlicensed, stripping of WOFF metadata).</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also supports both obfuscated and regular font resources for both OpenType and WOFF font
					formats. Support for obfuscated font resources is required to accommodate font licensing
					restrictions for many commercially available fonts. Refer to <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-font-obfuscation">Font Obfuscation</a> [[epub-33]] for more
					information.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-scripting">
				<h2>Scripting</h2>

				<p>EPUB strives to treat content <em>declaratively</em> — as data that can be manipulated, not as
					programs to be executed — but does support scripting as defined in [[html]] and [[svg]]. This allows
					publishers to build and add dynamic content such as quizzes, interactive games, and so forth.</p>

				<p>Scripting in an EPUB publication can create security considerations that are different from scripting
					within a web browser, however. For example, typical same-origin policies are not applicable to
					content that has been downloaded to a user's local system. For these reasons, scripting is best
					limited to cases where it is essential to the user experience, since it greatly increases the
					likelihood that content will not be portable across all reading systems and creates barriers to
					accessibility and content reusability.</p>

				<p>It is also important to note that EPUB 3 does not require scripting support in reading systems, and
					scripting might be disabled for security reasons. Publishers need to consider how their publications
					will remain readable by users before scripting content essential to its understanding.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-scripted-content">Scripting</a> [[epub-33]] for more information
					on scripting capabilities.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-semantic-enrichment">
				<h3>Semantic enrichment</h3>

				<p>[=XHTML content documents=] also include the means of annotating document markup with rich metadata,
					making them more semantically meaningful and useful both for processing and accessibility purposes.
					Publishers can use both RDFa [[rdfa-in-html]] and Microdata [[microdata]] attributes for this
					purpose, and also embed JSON-LD metadata records [[json-ld]] in the [[html]] [^script^] element.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-structural-semantics">
				<h3>Structural semantics</h3>

				<p>EPUB 3 also includes the [^/epub:type^] attribute [[epub-33]] for adding additional information to
					any element in an [=EPUB content document=] to express its purpose and meaning within the work.</p>

				<p>Although these semantics are primarily for use in publishers' internal workflows, they do provide
					enhanced [=reading system=] behaviors in some cases (specifically, for pop-up footnotes).</p>

				<p>Refer to <a data-cite="epub-33#app-structural-semantics">Expressing structural
					semantics</a> [[epub-33]] for more information.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-layouts">
			<h2>Layouts</h2>

			<section id="sec-reflow">
				<h3>Reflowable layouts</h3>

				<p>At its core, EPUB is designed for dynamic layout: content is typically intended to be formatted on
					the fly rather than being typeset in a paginated manner in advance. This core capability is useful
					for optimizing rendering onto different-sized device screens or window sizes, and it facilitates and
					simplifies content accessibility.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also offers metadata allowing publishers to specify their preferred rendering of reflowable
					content. Supporting reading systems could offer users a scrolled view of a reflowable document, for
					example, instead of paginating it.</p>

				<p>For more information, refer to <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-reflowable-layouts">Reflowable layouts</a>
					[[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-fxl">
				<h3>Fixed layouts</h3>

				<p>Although EPUB's history is steeped in enabling reflowable content, not all publications lend
					themselves easily to reflowing. Page-precise layouts are required to meaningfully represent
					children's books, comics and manga, magazines, and many other content forms.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 includes metadata that allows the creation of <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-fixed-layouts"
						>fixed-layout XHTML content documents</a> [[epub-33]], in addition to existing capabilities for
					fixed layouts in SVG. This metadata enables the control of the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-fxl-content-dimensions">page dimensions</a> [[epub-33]], creating a
					canvas on which elements can be absolutely positioned.</p>

				<p>The metadata does not just flag whether content is to be fixed or reflowed, but also allows
					publishers to specify the desired <a data-cite="epub-33#orientation">orientation of
					pages</a> [[epub-33]], when to <a data-cite="epub-33#spread">create synthetic
					spreads</a> [[epub-33]], and <a data-cite="epub-33#page-spread">how to position
					pages</a> [[epub-33]] within those spreads, providing a broad range of control over the presentation
					of EPUB publications.</p>

				<p>For more information, refer to <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-fixed-layouts">Fixed
					layouts</a> [[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-mediaoverlays">
			<h2>Media overlays</h2>

			<p id="para-media-overlay">Another key multimedia feature of EPUB 3 is the ability to define media overlays.
				When pre-recorded narration is available for an [=EPUB publication=], media overlays provide the ability
				to synchronize the playback of that audio with the text of an [=EPUB content document=]. Users can watch
				as the text of the publication is highlighted while it is read back to them, or just listen to the
				audio.</p>

			<p>Media overlays have benefits beyond the obvious accessibility one of allowing users who cannot see the
				content to listen to it. They are used, for example, to synchronize text and audio as a tool for
				learning to read.</p>

			<p>For more information about creating media overlays, refer to <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-media-overlays"
					>Media overlays</a> [[epub-33]].</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-gls">
			<h2>Global language support</h2>

			<p>EPUB 3 leverages the features in XHTML, SVG, CSS, or MathML for global language support, and it also
				relies on [[unicode]] for encoding the content. This means that [=EPUB content documents=] have the
				possibility to use different character sets and express bidirectional text, ruby annotations, or
				typography for many different languages and cultures.</p>

			<p>The following list describes some of the key additions for global language support that are specific to
				EPUB 3:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Alternate language metadata</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>EPUB 3 supports alternate representations of all text metadata items in the package metadata
						section to improve global distribution of [=EPUB publications=]. The <a
							data-cite="epub-33#alternate-script"><code>alternate-script</code> property</a> [[epub-33]]
						can be combined with the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute to include and identify alternate
						script renderings of language-specific metadata.</p>
					<p>Using this property, a Japanese EPUB publication could, for example, include an alternate
						Roman-script representation of the author's name and/or one or more representations of the title
						in a Romance language.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Base text direction</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Text metadata items may also rely on <a data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-dir">attributes specifying
							base direction</a> [[epub-33]] that allow for a finer control of bidirectional texts (e.g.,
						titles that combine Latin and Arabic or Hebrew characters). </p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Page progression direction</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The <code>page-progression-direction</code> attribute in the [=package document=] allows the
						content flow direction to be globally specified for all EPUB content documents to facilitate
						rendering (see the <a data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-spine-page-progression-direction"
							>page-progression-direction</a> [[epub-33]]).</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Fonts</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>EPUB 3 does not require that reading systems come with a set of built-in system fonts. As occurs
						in web contexts, users in a particular locale might have installed fonts that omit characters
						required for other locales and reading systems might utilize intrinsic fonts or font engines
						that do not utilize operating system installed fonts. As a result, the text content of an EPUB
						publication might not natively render as intended on all reading systems.</p>
					<p>EPUB 3's support for embedding fonts facilitates the rendering of text content by ensuring
						content is rendered as intended.</p>
					<p>Support for embedded fonts also ensures that publishers can embed characters and glyphs unique to
						an EPUB publication for proper display.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Container</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The OCF container format supports UTF-8, allowing for internationalized file and directory naming
						of content resources.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-accessibility">
			<h2>Accessibility</h2>

			<p>A major goal of EPUB is to facilitate content accessibility, and a variety of features in EPUB 3 support
				this requirement. More specifically, the EPUB Accessibility specification [[epub-a11y-11]] provides a
				framework for evaluating the accessibility of [=EPUB publications=]. It leverages the extensive work
				done to define web content accessibility in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[wcag21]], an
				internationally recognized standard for content accessibility.</p>

			<p>The specification defines requirements to produce [=EPUB publications=] that can be accessed by a wide
				range of users. It is accompanied by a techniques document [[epub-a11y-tech-11]] that outlines best
				practices for meeting these requirements.</p>

			<p>It is important to note that while accessibility is important in its own right, accessible content is
				also more valuable content: an accessible EPUB publication will be adaptable to more devices and be
				easier to reuse, in whole or in part, via human and automated workflows.</p>

			<p>Some specific content features of EPUB 3 that enable the creation of highly accessible content
				include:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>HTML semantic markup</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Compared to EPUB 2, the version of HTML supported in EPUB 3 incorporates a number of new elements
						that make markup more semantically meaningful. These include, for example, the [[html]]
						[^section^], [^nav^], and [^aside^] elements. These additions allow content to be better grouped
						and defined, both to represent the structure of documents and to facilitate their logical
						navigation.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>HTML multimedia elements</dt>
				<dd>
					<p data-cite="html">The [[html]] [^audio^] and [^video^] elements come with built-in controls that
						work with assistive technologies. These new elements allow users to control playback, no longer
						requiring plugins with poor accessibility support.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Reflowable layouts</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The default for EPUB publications is to reflow to fit the available screen space. This allows

			<h2>New and experimental features</h2>

			<p>EPUB 3 is continuously evolving with the web to adapt new features and technologies. The specification
				references a number of web standards that automatically becomes valid to use as soon as they change.
				HTML, for example, is now called a "living standard" because new features are added once there are at
				least two implementations. EPUB 3 also references versions of SVG [[svg]], JavaScript [[ecmascript]],
				and Unicode [[unicode]] that adapt to new releases, and the CSS reference is tied to the latest snapshot
				[[csssnapshot]].</p>

			<p>What this means for EPUB 3 is that as new features are added to these standards, they are also
				immediately valid to use in [=EPUB publications=]. (That does not mean it is always wise to use such
				features right away, as [=reading systems=] often take longer to implement support, and vendors may not
				always allow the new features past their validation routines.)</p>

			<p>The EPUB Working Group may also introduce new and experimental features from time-to-time outside of the
				core specifications. This is typically done because the features do not have sufficient real-world
				support in reading systems yet, or because the Working Group is looking for implementation feedback
				before trying to standardize the technology.</p>

			<p>There are currently two such experimental features: multiple-rendition publications
				[[epub-multi-rend-11]] and text-to-speech enhancements [[epub-tts-10]]. Publishers may use these
				features in their publications but should do so with the awareness that there may be limited
				support.</p>

			<h2>EPUB revision history</h2>

			<section id="epub2">
				<h3>OEB, OCF and EPUB 2: 1999—2010</h3>

				<p>EPUB has its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication Structure (OEBPS).
					OEBPS 1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an organization that later became the
					International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the
					IDPF in 2001 and 2002, respectively.</p>

				<p>It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for delivery as well as
					interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container format for OEPBS, which was
					approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS
					began in parallel which was renamed EPUB 2.0 in October 2007 and approved in September 2010. This
					revision consisted of a triumvirate of specifications: Open Package Format (OPF), Open Publication
					Format (OPF), and OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, which was a maintenance update to the 2.0 specification set,
					primarily intended to clarify and correct errata in the specifications. See [[opf-201]] [[ops-201]]
					[[ocf-201]]. </p>

			<section id="epub30">
				<h3>EPUB 3.0: 2010</h3>

				<p>Work on a major revision of the EPUB specifications began in 2010, with the goal of aligning EPUB
					more closely with HTML, and in the process bringing new, native multimedia features, sophisticated
					CSS layout rendering and font embedding, MathML support, scripted interactivity, vertical writing
					and other enhanced global language support, and improved accessibility. A new specification for EPUB
					Media Overlays was also introduced, allowing for text and audio synchronization in EPUB
					publications. To better align the specification names with the standard, the Open Package Format
					specification was renamed EPUB publications, and the Open Publication Format specification was
					renamed EPUB Content Documents. The EPUB 3.0 specifications were approved in October 2011.
					See [[epubpublications-30]] [[epubcontentdocs-30]] [[ocf-30]] [[epubmediaoverlays-30]]

			</section>

			<section id="epub301">
				<h3>EPUB 3.0.1: 2014</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3.0.1 revision was undertaken in 2013-14. Although introducing mostly minor fixes and
					updates, it did see the integration of Fixed Layout Documents, which give publishers greater control
					over presentation when a reflowable EPUB is not suitable for the content.
					See [[epubpublications-301]] [[epubcontentdocs-301]] [[ocf-301]] [[epubmediaoverlays-301]]

			</section>

			<section id="epub31">
				<h3>EPUB 3.1: 2017</h3>

				<p>EPUB 3.1 was the first minor revision of EPUB 3. The goal of this revision was to better align EPUB 3
					with current web standards. References to important standards were made undated, meaning that
					whenever they are updated they are legal to use in EPUB 3 content (e.g., the latest version of HTML
					is always valid to use; a revision of EPUB is not needed). The use of CSS was also clarified, and
					the use of EPUB-specific properties reduced.</p>

				<p>Many EPUB-specific features were also removed from the standard, in particular content switching,
					triggers, and bindings. This change necessitated a new package document version number.
					See [[epub-31]] [[epubpackages-31]] [[epubcontentdocs-31]] [[ocf-31]] [[epubmediaoverlays-31]]

			<section id="epub32">
				<h3>EPUB 3.2: 2018</h3>

				<p>The work on EPUB 3.2 was undertaken shortly after EPUB 3.1 to restore compatibility of content to
					EPUB 3. The change of version number introduced in EPUB 3.1 meant that publishers, vendors and
					reading system developers would have to produce, distribute, and consume two versions of EPUB
					content, but the costs of this change outweighed the benefits of the new version. EPUB 3.2 instead
					keeps all the best parts of EPUB 3.1 but deprecates elements instead of removing them so that a new
					version number is not necessary in the package document. See [[epub-32]] [[epubpackages-32]]
					[[epubcontentdocs-32]] [[ocf-32]] [[epubmediaoverlays-32]] [[epubchanges-32]]</p>

			<section id="epub33">
				<h3>EPUB 3.3: 2022</h3>

				<p>The work on EPUB 3.3 [[epub-33]] was undertaken in 2020-21, and is the first version of the EPUB 3
					series published as a W3C Recommendation. EPUB 3.3 does not include any significant technical change
					to, and is strongly backward compatible with, EPUB 3.2. This means that any valid EPUB 3.2
					Publication is also a valid EPUB 3.3 Publication. </p>

				<p>The documents themselves have been restructured. The primary motivation for this restructuring, as
					well as an extensive editorial revision, was to make the documents more readable. Also, as part of
					the thorough testing regime developed by the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org//publishing/groups/epub-wg/">W3C EPUB 3 Working Group</a>, this
					restructuring led to the separation of Recommendations and Working Group Notes (see also <a
						href="#app-documents">the detailed list of documents</a> ). Features specified in the
					Recommendations are thoroughly tested, are widely implemented in reading systems, and they can be
					considered as interoperable. On the other hand, features specified in Working Group Notes, although
					they may have some authoring uptakes, still lack support in reading systems; as a result, these
					technologies should not yet be considered stable and interoperable.</p>

				<p>The separate <a data-cite="epub-33#change-log">section</a> in [[epub-33]] provides a more detailed
					overview of the changes.</p>
