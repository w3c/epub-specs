			<h1>Features</h1>

			<p>This section covers the major features of EPUB, including important components and topics that apply to
				the process of authoring <a>EPUB Publications</a> as a whole.</p>

			<figure id="fig-epub-structure">
				<figcaption> The following example visually represents the structure of an EPUB publication. </figcaption>

				<p> 'EPUB (OCF) Container' as the outer most component which encapsulates the 'EPUB Publication'
					containing two documents 'Publication Document' and 'Navigation Document' along with a inner
					component labelled 'Publication Resources' which contains multiple 'Content Documents' (XHTML, SVG),
					and multiple 'Other resources' (CSS, png, mp3, mov, ...). </p>
			</details>

			<section id="sec-package-file">
				<h2>Package Document</h2>

				<p>Every EPUB Publication is represented by a <a>Package Document</a>. The Package Document specifies
					all the resources required to render that representation of the content. The Package Document also
					defines a reading order for linear consumption, and associates metadata and navigation
					information.</p>

				<p>The Package Document defines a layer on top of the traditional structuring of a typical Web site to
					facilitate the authoring of digital publications. A Web site, for example, embeds references to its
					resources within its content, which, while a simple and flexible means of identifying resources,
					makes it difficult to enumerate all the resources required to render it. In addition, there is no
					standard way for a Web site to define that a sequence of pages make up a larger publication, which
					is precisely what EPUB's <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-spine-elem"><code>spine</code> element</a>
					[[EPUB-33]] does (i.e., it provides an external declarative means to explicitly specify navigation
					through a collection of documents). Finally, the Package Document defines a standard way to
					represent metadata globally applicable to a collection of pages.</p>

				<p>The Package Document also includes a <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-collection-elem"
							><code>collection</code> element</a> [[EPUB-33]], which allows grouping of logically related
						<a>Publication Resources</a>. This element exists to enable the development of specialized
					content identification, processing and rendering features, such as the ability to define embedded
					preview content, or assemble an index or dictionary from its constituent XHTML Content
					Documents.</p>

				<p class="note"> The <code>collection</code> element not currently used in any specifications that are
					actively maintained by the EPUB 3 Working Group. Its future use in authoring EPUB Publications is
					uncertain. </p>

				<p>The Package Document is specified in the dedicated <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav-def-hidden"
						>section</a> of [[EPUB-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-nav">
				<h2>Navigation</h2>

				<section id="sec-nav-order">
					<h3>Reading Order</h3>

					<p>A key concept of EPUB is that an EPUB Publication consists of multiple resources that can be
						completely navigated and consumed by a person or program <em>in some specific order</em>.</p>

					<p>Many types of publication have an obvious reading order, or logical progression through their
						content. A novel is an example of a highly sequential document — it typically has a beginning,
						middle, and end — but not all publications are so ordered: a cookbook or a collection of
						photographic images might be considered to be more like a database. All documents do, however,
						have at least one logical ordering of all their top-level content items, whether by date, topic,
						location, or some other criteria (e.g., a cookbook is typically arranged by recipe type).</p>

					<p>Each EPUB Publication defines at least one such logical ordering of all its top-level content in
						the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-spine-elem">spine</a> of the <a href="#sec-package-file">Package
							Document</a> [[EPUB-33]]. Each one also defines a declarative table of contents in the <a
							href="#sec-nav-nav-doc">EPUB Navigation Document</a> [[EPUB-33]]. EPUB Publications make
						these data structures available in a machine-readable way <em>external</em> to the content,
						simplifying their discovery and use.</p>

					<p>EPUB Publications are not limited to the linear ordering of their contents, nor do they preclude
						linking in arbitrary ways — just like the Web, EPUB Publications are built on hypertext — but
						the basic consumption and navigation can be reliably accomplished in a way that is not true for
						a set of HTML pages.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-nav-nav-doc">
					<h3>Navigation Document</h3>

					<p>Each EPUB Publication contains a special XHTML Content Document called the <a>EPUB Navigation
							Document</a>, which uses the [[HTML]] <a data-cite="html#the-nav-element"
							><code>nav</code></a> element to define human- and machine-readable navigation information.
						All Reading Systems make use of the Navigation Document to present a table of content to their
						users.</p>

					<p>The Navigation Document contains baseline accessibility and navigation support, and features to
						enhance navigation for all users. Prime among these are support for internationalization (for
						example, as an XHTML document itself, the Navigation Document natively supports <a
							data-cite="html#the-ruby-element">ruby annotations</a>) and support for embedded grammars
						(MathML and SVG can be included within navigation links).</p>

					<p>Note that EPUB Reading Systems are not <em>required</em> to use these advanced XHTML features,
						such as ruby annotations, when generating a Reading System specific table of contents. However,
						authors may also include the navigation document in the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-spine-elem"
							>spine</a> [[EPUB-33]], which then (also) rendered making use of all the rendering
						possibilities.</p>

					<p>Navigation Documents also provide a flexible means of tailoring the navigation display using CSS
						and the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav-def-hidden"><code>hidden</code> attribute</a> [[EPUB-33]]
						while not impacting access to information for accessible Reading Systems.</p>

					<p>The structure and semantics of Navigation Documents are defined in the dedicated <a
							data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">section</a> of [[EPUB-33]].</p>

				</section>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-metadata">
				<h2>Metadata</h2>

				<p>EPUB Publications provide a rich array of options for adding metadata. Each Package Document includes
					a dedicated <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-metadata-elem"><code>metadata</code> section</a> [[EPUB-33]]
					for general information about the EPUB Publication, allowing titles, authors, identifiers, and other
					information about the EPUB Publication to be easily accessed. It also provides the means to attach
					complete bibliographic records using the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-link-elem"><code>link</code>
						element</a> [[EPUB-33]].</p>

				<p>The Package Document also allows a <a>Unique Identifier</a> to be established for the EPUB
					Publication using the <a data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-package-unique-identifier"
							><code>unique-identifier</code> attribute</a> [[EPUB-33]].</p>

				<p>XHTML Content Documents also include the means of annotating document markup with rich metadata,
					making them more semantically meaningful and useful both for processing and accessibility purposes.
					Both RDFa [[RDFA-IN-HTML]] and Microdata [[Microdata]] attributes can be used in XHTML Content
					Documents for that purpose. </p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-content-docs">
				<h2>Content Documents</h2>

				<p>Each EPUB Publication contains one or more <a>EPUB Content Documents</a>, as defined in the dedicated
						<a data-cite="epub-33#sec-contentdocs">section</a> of [[EPUB-33]]. These are XHTML or SVG
					documents that describe the readable content and reference associated media resources (e.g., images,
					audio, and video clips).</p>

				<p><a>XHTML Content Documents</a> are defined by a profile of [[HTML]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-fxl">
				<h2>Fixed Layouts</h2>

				<p>Although EPUB's history is steeped in enabling reflowable content, not all publications lend
					themselves easily to reflowing. Page-precise layouts are required to meaningfully represent
					children's books, comics and manga, magazines, and many other content forms.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 includes metadata that allows the creation of <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-fixed-layouts"
						>fixed-layout XHTML Content Documents</a> [[EPUB-33]], in addition to existing capabilities for
					fixed layouts in SVG. This metadata enables the control of the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-fxl-content-dimensions">page dimensions</a> [[EPUB-33]], creating a
					canvas on which elements can be absolutely positioned.</p>

				<p>The metadata does not just flag whether content is to be fixed or reflowed, but also allows EPUB
					Creators to specify the desired <a data-cite="epub-33#orientation">orientation of
					pages</a> [[EPUB-33]], when to <a data-cite="epub-33#spread">create synthetic
					spreads</a> [[EPUB-33]], and <a data-cite="epub-33#page-spread">how to position
					pages</a> [[EPUB-33]] within those spreads, providing a broad range of control over the presentation
					of EPUB Publications.</p>

				<p>The <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-fixed-layouts">structure and semantics of EPUB Documents with Fixed
						Layouts</a> are defined in [[EPUB-33]].</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-rendering">
				<h2>Rendering and CSS</h2>

				<p>A key concept of EPUB is that content presentation adapts to the user, rather than the user having to
					adapt to a particular presentation of content. HTML was originally designed to support dynamic
					rendering of structured content, but over time HTML as supported in Web browsers has become focused
					on the needs of Web applications, and many popular Web sites now have layouts with less
					flexibility.</p>

				<p>EPUB Publications, however, are designed to maximize accessibility for the visually impaired, and
					Reading Systems typically perform text line layout and pagination on the fly, adapting to the size
					of the display area, the user's preferred font size, and other environmental factors. This behavior
					is not guaranteed in EPUB; images, vector graphics, video, and other non-reflowable content might be
					included, and some Reading Systems might not paginate on the fly, or at all. Nevertheless,
					supporting dynamic adaptive layout and accessibility has been a primary design consideration
					throughout the evolution of the EPUB standard.</p>

				<p>EPUB Content Documents can reference CSS Style Sheets, allowing EPUB Creators to define the desired
					rendering properties. EPUB 3 follows support for CSS as defined in the [[CSSSnapshot]].</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also supports CSS styles that enable both horizontal and vertical layout and both
					left-to-right and right-to-left writing.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-multimedia">
				<h2>Multimedia</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports audio and video embedded in <a>XHTML Content Documents</a> via the [[HTML]] <a
						data-cite="html#the-audio-element"><code>audio</code></a> and <a
						data-cite="html#the-video-element"><code>video</code></a> elements, inheriting all the
					functionality and features these elements provide. For more information on audio and video formats,
					refer to the section on <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-core-media-types">core media
					types</a> [[EPUB-33]].</p>

				<p id="para-media-overlay">Another key multimedia feature in EPUB 3 is the inclusion of <a>Media Overlay
						Documents</a> [[EPUB-33]]. When pre-recorded narration is available for an EPUB Publication,
					Media Overlays provide the ability to synchronize that audio with the text of a Content Document
					(see also <a href="#sec-access-overlays"></a>).</p>

				<p>The <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-media-overlays">structure and semantics of EPUB Documents with Media
						Overlays</a> are defined in [[EPUB-33]].</p>


			</section>

			<section id="sec-fonts">
				<h2>Fonts</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports two closely related font formats — OpenType [[OpenType]] and WOFF [[WOFF]]
					[[WOFF2]] — to accommodate both traditional publishing workflows and emerging Web-based workflows.
					Word processing programs used to create EPUB Publications are likely to have access only to a
					collection of installed OpenType fonts, for example, whereas Web-archival EPUB generators will
					likely only have access to WOFF resources (which cannot be converted to OpenType without
					undesirable, and potentially unlicensed, stripping of WOFF metadata).</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also supports both obfuscated and regular font resources for both OpenType and WOFF font
					formats. Support for obfuscated font resources is required to accommodate font licensing
					restrictions for many commercially available fonts. See the dedicated <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-font-obfuscation">section on Font Obfuscation</a> in [[EPUB-33]]
					for more details.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-scripting">
				<h2>Scripting</h2>

				<p>EPUB strives to treat content <em>declaratively</em> — as data that can be manipulated, not as
					programs to be executed — but does support scripting as defined in [[HTML]] and [[SVG]] (refer to
					the section on <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-scripted-content">Scripting</a> [[EPUB-33]] for more
					information).</p>

				<p>It is important to note, however, that EPUB 3 does not require scripting support in Reading Systems,
					and scripting might be disabled for security reasons.</p>

				<p>EPUB Creators need to be aware that scripting in an EPUB Publication can create security
					considerations that are different from scripting within a Web browser. For example, typical
					same-origin policies are not applicable to content that has been downloaded to a user's local
					system. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged that scripting be limited to container constrained
					contexts, as further described in the section on <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-scripted-container-constrained">Container-Constrained
					Scripts</a> [[EPUB-33]].</p>

				<p>In other words, consider limiting scripting to cases where it is essential to the user experience,
					since it greatly increases the likelihood that content will not be portable across all Reading
					Systems and creates barriers to accessibility and content reusability.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-tts">
				<h2>Text-to-speech</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 provides the following text-to-speech (TTS) facilities for controlling aspects of speech
					synthesis, such as pronunciation, prosody, and voice characteristics:</p>

				<dl class="labels">
					<dt>Pronunciation Lexicons</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The inclusion of generic pronunciation lexicons using the W3C PLS format
							[[PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]] enables EPUB Creators to provide pronunciation rules that apply to
							the entire EPUB Publication. Refer to <a data-cite="epub-tts-10#pls">Pronunciation
								Lexicons</a> [[EPUB-TTS-10]] for more information.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Inline SSML Phonemes</dt>
					<dd>
						<p> The incorporation of SSML phonemes functionality [[SSML]] directly into a <a>EPUB Content
								Document</a> enables fine-grained pronunciation control, taking precedence over default
							pronunciation rules and/or referenced pronunciation lexicons (as provided by the PLS format
							mentioned above). Refer to <a data-cite="epub-tts-10#ssml">SSML Attributes</a>
							[[EPUB-TTS-10]] for more information.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>Note that EPUB Creators may also rely on CSS Speech [[CSS-SPEECH-1]] properties in their style sheet
					definitions.</p>

				<p>The authoring features for improving the voicing of EPUB 3 publication are described in the separate
					Working Group Note on Text-to-Speech Enhancements [[EPUB-TTS-10]].</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-container">
				<h2>Container</h2>

				<p>An EPUB Publication is transported and interchanged as a single file (a "portable document") that
					contains the Package Documents, all Content Documents, and all other required resources for
					processing the Publication. The single-file container format for EPUB is based on the widely adopted
					ZIP format, and an XML document that identifies the location of the Package Document for the
					Publication in the ZIP archive is located at a pre-defined location within the archive.</p>

				<p>This approach provides a clear contract between any creator of an EPUB Publication and any system
					which consumes such EPUB Publications, as well as a reliable representation that is independent of
					network transport or file system specifics.</p>

				<p>An EPUB Publication's representation as a container file is specified in the dedicated <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-ocf">section</a> of [[EPUB-33]].</p>

			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-gls">
			<h1>Global Language Support</h1>


			<p> EPUB 3 leverages on the features in XHTML, SVG, CSS, or MathML for global language support, and it also
				relies on [[Unicode]] for encoding the content. This means that content documents in EPUB 3 have the
				possibility to use different character sets, express bidirectional text, ruby annotations, or typography
				for many different languages and cultures. Features have also been added to the various components
				defined by EPUB 3 to ensure language support. </p>

			<section id="sec-gls-metadata">
				<h2>Metadata</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports alternate representations of all text metadata items in the package metadata section
					to improve global distribution of EPUB Publications. The <a data-cite="epub-33#alternate-script"
							><code>alternate-script</code> property</a> [[EPUB-33]] can be combined with the
						<code>xml:lang</code> attribute to include and identify alternate script renderings of
					language-specific metadata.</p>

				<p>Using this property, a Japanese EPUB Publication could, for example, include an alternate
					Roman-script representation of the author's name and/or one or more representations of the title in
					a Romance language.</p>

				<p>Text metadata items may also rely on <a data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-dir">attributes specifying base
						direction</a> [[EPUB-33]] that allow for a finer control of bidirectional texts (e.g., titles
					that combine Latin and Arabic or Hebrew characters). </p>

				<p>Finally, the <code>page-progression-direction</code> attribute allows the content flow direction to
					be globally specified for all Content Documents to facilitate rendering (see the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-spine-page-progression-direction">page-progression-direction</a>
					[[EPUB-33]]).</p>
			</section>

			<!-- <section id="sec-gls-fonts">
				<h2>Fonts</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 does not require that Reading Systems come with a set of built-in system fonts. As occurs in
					Web contexts, users in a particular locale might have installed fonts that omit characters required
					for other locales and Reading Systems might utilize intrinsic fonts or font engines that do not
					utilize operating system installed fonts. As a result, the text content of an EPUB Publication might
					not natively render as intended on all Reading Systems.</p>

				<p>To address this problem, EPUB 3 supports the embedding of fonts to facilitate the rendering of text
					content, and this practice is advised to ensure content is rendered as intended. See also <a
						href="#sec-fonts"></a> in the Features section for more information.</p>

				<p>Support for embedded fonts also ensures that characters and glyphs unique to an EPUB Publication can
					be embedded for proper display.</p>

			</section> -->

			<section id="sec-gls-tts">
				<h2>Text-to-speech</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3's support for PLS documents and SSML attributes increases the pronunciation control that EPUB
					Creators have over the rendering of any natural language in text-to-speech-enabled Reading Systems.
					Refer to <a href="#sec-tts"></a> in the Features section for more information on these
					capabilities.</p>

				<p>The combination of CSS Speech and inline SSML phonemes also allows fine control over ruby.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-gls-container">
				<h2>Container</h2>

				<p>The OCF container format supports UTF-8, allowing for internationalized file and directory naming of
					content resources.</p>

			</section>

		</section>
		<section id="sec-accessibility">
			<h1>Accessibility</h1>

			<p>A major goal of EPUB is to facilitate content accessibility, and a variety of features in EPUB 3 support
				this requirement. This section reviews these features, detailing some established best practices for
				ensuring that EPUB Publications are accessible where applicable.</p>

			<p>EPUB 3 also includes an Accessibility specification [[EPUB-A11Y-11]] that leverages the extensive work
				done to make Web content accessible in [[WCAG21]]. The specification defines requirements to produce
				EPUB Publications that can be accessed by a wide range of users. It is accompanied by a techniques
				document [[EPUB-A11Y-TECH-11]] that outlines best practices for meeting these requirements.</p>

			<p>It is important to note that while accessibility is important in its own right, accessible content is
				also more valuable content: an accessible EPUB Publication will be adaptable to more devices and be
				easier to reuse, in whole or in part, via human and automated workflows. The EPUB Working Group strongly
				recommends that EPUB Creators ensure that they generate accessible content.</p>

			<section id="sec-access-nav">
				<h2>Navigation</h2>

				<p>As noted in <a href="#sec-nav-nav-doc"></a> above, the navigation features represent a universal and
					flexible navigation system.</p>

				<p>The Navigation Document can also be reused in the body of an EPUB Publication by including it in the
						<a data-cite="epub-33#sec-spine-elem"><code>spine</code></a>. To avoid the situation in highly
					structured documents where it might not be desirable to display the complete table of contents to
					users in the body, the display level can be modified using the [[HTML]] <a
						data-cite="html#the-hidden-attribute"><code>hidden</code></a> attribute. This attribute is
					ignored by Reading Systems when they render the table of contents outside the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-spine-elem"><code>spine</code></a> (e.g., in their own specialized
					views), which avoids minimizing the information that is available.</p>

				<p>EPUB Creators are also encouraged to supply additional <a data-cite="html#the-nav-element"
							><code>nav</code></a> elements if their EPUB Publications contain non-structural points of
					interest, such as figures, tables, etc., to further enhance access to the content.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-access-semantic-markup">
				<h2>Semantic Markup</h2>

				<p>[[HTML]] supports a number of elements that make markup more semantically meaningful (e.g., <a
						data-cite="html#the-section-element"><code>section</code></a>, <a
						data-cite="html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code></a>, and <a data-cite="html#the-aside-element"
							><code>aside</code></a>). EPUB Creators are encouraged to use these elements, in conjunction
					with best practices for authoring well-structured Web content, when creating EPUB XHTML Content
					Documents. These additions allow content to be better grouped and defined, both for representing the
					structure of documents and to facilitate their logical navigation. XHTML Content Documents also
					natively support the inclusion of ARIA role and state attributes and events, including the dedicated
					[[DPUB-ARIA-1.0]] roles, enhancing the ability of Assistive Technologies to interact with the
					content.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 includes the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-epub-type-attribute"><code>epub:type</code></a>
					attribute, which is meant to be functionally equivalent to the W3C Role Attribute
					[[Role-Attribute]]. This attribute allows any element in an XHTML Content Document to include
					additional information about its purpose and meaning within the work, using controlled vocabularies
					and terms. Refer to the section on <a data-cite="epub-33#app-structural-semantics">Expressing
						Structural Semantics</a> [[EPUB-33]] for more information.</p>

				<p class="ednote"> With the latest resolution of the WG making the structural vocabulary a note, one may
					wonder whether referring to epub:type should stay in the Overview document... </p>

				<h2>Dynamic Layouts</h2>

				<p>The design center of EPUB is dynamic layout: content is typically intended to be formatted on the fly
					rather than being typeset in a paginated manner in advance (i.e., expecting a particular sized
					"page"). This core capability is useful, for example, for optimizing rendering onto different sized
					device screens or window sizes, and it facilitates and simplifies content accessibility.</p>

				<p>While it is possible to incorporate more highly formatted content in EPUB — for example via bitmap
					images or SVG graphics, or even use of CSS explicit positioning and/or table elements to achieve
					particular visual layouts — EPUB Creators are strongly discouraged from utilizing such techniques.
					They are not reliable in EPUB since many Reading Systems render content in a paginated manner rather
					than creating a single scrolling <a>Viewport</a> and since each Reading System might define its own
					pagination algorithm. If these techniques are necessary to convey the content of the publication,
					consider including <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-foreign-restrictions">fallbacks</a> [[EPUB-33]] (e.g.,
					for graphic novels).</p>

				<p>In general, it is preferable to achieve visual richness by using CSS Style Sheets without absolute
					sizing or positioning.</p>

				<p class="ednote"> If and when the WG publishes a fxl accessibility note then it is worth referring to
					it from here </p>

				<h2>Aural Renditions and Media Overlays</h2>

				<p>Aural renderings of content are important for accessibility and are a desirable feature for many
					other users. A baseline to facilitate aural rendering is to utilize semantic HTML designed for
					dynamic layout. Refer to <a href="#sec-tts"></a> for more information on how to use the native
					facilities that EPUB XHTML Documents include.</p>

				<p><a data-cite="epub-33#sec-media-overlays">Media Overlays</a> [[EPUB-33]] provide the ability to
					synchronize the text and audio content of an EPUB Publication. Overlays transcend the accessibility
					domain in their usefulness: the synchronization of text and audio as a tool for learning to read,
					for example, being of benefit in many circumstances.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-access-fallbacks">
				<h2>Fallbacks</h2>

				<p>Not all formats are accessible in their native format, and not all users prefer to read in the
					default format provided. EPUB defines a variety of means for providing fallbacks so that alternate
					renderings can be made available in these cases.</p>

				<p>Publication- and content-level fallbacks are defined in the section on <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-foreign-restrictions">Foreign Resources</a> [[EPUB-33]]. These fallback
					mechanisms enable the inclusion of Foreign Resources in an EPUB Publication and ensure compatibility
					of EPUB 3 content across Reading Systems with varying capabilities (e.g., they allow the inclusion
					of multiple video formats, and the inclusion of XHTML fallbacks to SVG Content Documents for EPUB 2
					Reading Systems).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-access-scripting">
				<h2>Scripting</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 adopts a progressive enhancement approach for scripted content, whereby scripting is not
					allowed to interfere with the integrity of the document (i.e., not result in information loss when
					scripting is not available). Consequently, although documents that do employ scripting <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-scripted-content">can provide fallbacks</a> [[EPUB-33]] to further
					facilitate access to their contents, the documents have to be accessible without them.</p>

				<p>EPUB Creators should always implement best practices for accessible scripting in Web documents, such
					as provided in [[WAI-ARIA]], and reserve the use of scripting for situations in which interactivity
					is critical to the user experience.</p>

				<h3>OEB, OCF and EPUB 2: 1999—2010</h3>

				<p>EPUB has its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication Structure (OEBPS).
					OEBPS 1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an organization that later became the
					International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the
					IDPF in 2001 and 2002, respectively.</p>

				<p>It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for delivery as well as
					interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container format for OEPBS, which was
					approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS
					began in parallel which was approved as the renamed EPUB 2.0 in October 2007, consisting of a
					triumvirate of specifications: Open Package Format (OPF), Open Publication Format (OPF) together
					with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a maintenance update to the 2.0 specification set primarily intended clarify
					and correct errata in the specifications, was approved in September 2010. [[OPF-201]] [[OPS-201]]

				<h3>EPUB 3.0: 2010</h3>

				<p>Work on a major revision of the EPUB specifications began in 2010, with the goal of aligning EPUB
					more closely with HTML, and in the process bringing new, native multimedia features, sophisticated
					CSS layout rendering and font embedding, scripted interactivity, enhanced global language support,
					and improved accessibility. A new specification, EPUB Media Overlays was also introduced, enabling
					text and audio synchronization in EPUB Publications. To better align the specification names with
					the standard, the Open Package Format specification was renamed EPUB Publications and the Open
					Publication Format specification was renamed EPUB Content Documents. The EPUB 3.0 specifications
					were approved in October 2011. [[EPUBPublications-30]] [[EPUBContentDocs-30]] [[OCF-30]]

				<h3>EPUB 3.0.1: 2014</h3>
				<p>The EPUB 3.0.1 revision was undertaken in 2013-14. Although introducing mostly minor fixes and
					updates, it did see the integration of Fixed Layout Documents, which give EPUB Creators greater
					control over presentation when a reflowable EPUB is not suitable for the content.

				<h3>EPUB 3.1: 2017</h3>
				<p>EPUB 3.1 was the first minor revision of EPUB 3. The goal of this revision was to better align EPUB 3
					with current Web standards. References to important standards were made undated, meaning that
					whenever they are updated they are legal to use in EPUB 3 content (e.g., the latest version of HTML
					is always valid to use; a revision of EPUB is not needed). The use of CSS was also clarified, and
					the use of EPUB-specific properties reduced.</p>
				<p>Many EPUB-specific features were also removed from the standard, in particular content switching,
					triggers, and bindings. This change necessitated a new Package Document version number.[[EPUB-31]]

				<h3>EPUB 3.2: 2018</h3>
				<p>The work on EPUB 3.2 was undertaken shortly after EPUB 3.1 to restore compatibility of content to
					EPUB 3. The change of version number introduced in EPUB 3.1 meant that EPUB Creators, vendors and
					reading system developers would have to produce, distribute and consume two versions of EPUB
					content, but the costs of this change outweighed the benefits of the new version. EPUB 3.2 instead
					keeps all the best parts of EPUB 3.1 but returns and deprecates the removed elements so that a new
					version number is not necessary in the Package Document. [[EPUB-32]] [[EPUBPackages-32]]

				<h3>EPUB 3.3: 2022</h3>
				<p>The work on EPUB 3.3 [[EPUB-33]] was undertaken in 2020-21, and is the first version of the EPUB 3
					series published as a W3C Recommendation. EPUB 3.3 does not include any significant technical change
					to, and is strongly backward compatible with, EPUB 3.2. This means that any valid EPUB 3.2
					Publication is also a valid EPUB 3.3 Publication. </p>

				<p>The documents themselves have been restructured. The primary motivation for this restructuring, as
					well as an extensive editorial revision, was to make the documents more readable. Also, as part of
					the thorough testing regime developed by the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org//publishing/groups/epub-wg/">W3C EPUB 3 Working Group</a>, this
					restructuring led to the separation of Recommendations and Working Group Notes (see also <a
						href="#sec-documents">the detailed list of documents</a> ). Features specified in the
					Recommendations are thoroughly tested, are widely implemented in Reading Systems, and they can be
					considered as interoperable. On the other hand, features specified in Working Group Notes, although
					they may have some authoring uptakes, still lack support in Reading Systems; as a result, these
					technologies should not yet be considered stable and interoperable.</p>

					detailed overview of the changes.</p>
