        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <section id="intro-overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>EPUB fixed layout (FXL) publications, or publications where the print layout is preserved in the digital edition, have been around since before EPUB 3.0.1. These publications span a number of genres and types, from comic books, cook books, children's books, and more.</p>

            <p>An accessible fixed layout EPUB file is one that meets the accessibility requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 level AA[[wcag2]] and EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]], including color contrast, reading order, font layout, structural navigation, metadata, and text alternatives.</p>

            <p>The main motivation behind creating fixed layout publications is the need to preserve the print layout of the book, either because of it's importance to the text (i.e. complex diagrams) or it's artistic purpose (i.e. illustrated text). However, these publications are often partially or completely inaccessible to people with print disabilities.</p>

            <p>This note serves to help <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a>, publishers, and reading systems address some of the common accessibility issues found in fixed layout content including navigation, reading order, and text alternatives. This document is a companion to EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]], specifically for fixed layout publications. All recommendations made in EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]], EPUB 3.3 [[epub-33]], and EPUB Reading Systems 3.3 [[epub-rs-33]] are applied and extended here.</p>

            <p>In addition to the recommendations in this document, the Publishing Maintenance Working Group's Fixed Layout Accessibility Task Force is producing an accompanying <a href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/fxl-a11y-tech">techniques document</a> to cover the technical side of FXL accessibility.</p>

        <section id="intro-limits">
            <h3>The limits of fixed layout accessibility</h3>

            <p>Fixed layout publications present some unique challenges for accessibility. The requirements laid out in EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]] recommend WCAG 2 level AA [[wcag2]], but for some use cases in fixed layout, that might not be possible without changes to the content.</p>

            <p>In particular, the needs of people with low vision or learning disabilities that rely on the transformation of text (i.e. dyslexia) are still almost impossible to accommodate in fixed layout content. EPUB creators concerned about this may choose not to use fixed layout.</p>

            <p>We want to recognize these challenges for EPUB creators, and in this document will outline some recommendations for producing more accessible fixed layout content. We encourage EPUB creators to explore the full range of options for accessibility that digital publications present, even when creating fixed layout publications.</p>

            <p>Reading systems also play a role in presenting accessible content. This document will outline considerations specific to accessibility for fixed layout in reading systems, and methods reading systems can apply to make content more accessible.</p>

        <section id="development-considerations">
            <h3>Considerations for fixed layout content development</h3>

            <p>EPUB 3.3 [[epub-33]] supports multiple methods for content development, particularly for fixed layout content. The two primary methods are to use XHTML and SVG for building EPUB content documents. A third method used in many EPUB FXL books is to reference image files in the spine of the EPUB file. We will discuss the accessibility considerations for all three methods in this document.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="reading-order">
            <h3>Reading order</h3>

            <blockquote>A key concept of EPUB is that an EPUB publication consists of multiple resources that can be completely navigated and consumed by a person or program in some specific order. - 1.2.1 Reading Order EPUB 3.3 Overview [[epub-overview-33]]</blockquote>

            <p>Whereas many reflowable publications have an obvious reading order, or logical progression through their content, fixed-layout publications are often more complex in their design and layout and may consist of multiple readable objects on the same page.</p>

            <p>For viewers of the visual page, the reading order can be inferred by various visual triggers including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Size and styles of font used</li>
                <li>Design features such as imagery and colored backgrounds</li>
                <li>Position on the page top to bottom, left to right (when using left to right page progression)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition, there may be additional text and image objects on the fixed layout page which are not required to be included in reading order, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Page numbers</li>
                <li>Running headers</li>
                <li>Other purely decorative objects</li>
            </ul>

            <section id="reading-order-altering">
                <h4>Altering the reading order</h4>

                <blockquote>If a blind user, who reads the page with a screen reader that follows the source order, is working with a sighted user who reads the page in visual order, they may be confused when they encounter information in different orders. A user with low vision who uses a screen magnifier in combination with a screen reader may be confused when the reading order appears to skip around on the screen. A keyboard user may have trouble predicting where focus will go next when the source order does not match the visual order. - <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C27">Making the DOM order match the visual order</a></blockquote>

            </section>

            <section id="reading-order-removing">
                <h4>Removing items from the reading order</h4>

                <p>There may be cases when text appears on the page but is unnecessary, duplicated or otherwise confusing for it to be added to the reading order. e.g. page numbers, section or chapter headings which are already part of the publication’s structure or text used for visual effects.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="reading-order-spreads">
                <h4>Reading order across the 'fold'</h4>

                <p>Fixed layout documents can be presented as synthetic spreads when a left and right page are presented together as a spread. As each page of the fixed-layout document is a separate XHTML document it is expected that reading order moves through there document from left to right (when using left to right page progression) but is not possible for the reading order to move from the left to the right and then back to the left page again.</p>

                <p>If the text must be read in this way, the only solution to maintain the correct reading order is to convert the double page spread in to a single landscape page that contains the entire content of the spread and for the EPUB to be rendered as single pages.</p>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section id="images">
            <h3>Images in fixed layout</h3>

            <section id="images-overview">
                <h4>Overview</h4>

                <p>Images are often an integral part of fixed layout publications. Fixed layout publications sometimes consist entirely of images, in the case of comics, or images may be used as backgrounds to a story, as in children's books. Fixed layout content where images serve as both the content and the layout pose a particular challenge for EPUB creators interested in accessibility.</p>

                <p>Ensuring that the information conveyed in the images is available to users who may not be able to perceive the image or may have difficulty processing it, is consequently of high priority in making fixed layouts as accessible as possible.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/images.html">basic requirements for all images</a> are to provide alternative text and extended descriptions when they contain information necessary to understanding the publication, which applies to fixed layouts. For example, while a reader may be able to follow the dialogue of a story when it is overlaid as text, only the placement on image might give context to what character is saying what.</p>

                <p>One challenge with fixed layouts is finding ways to describe the image and provide context given that there is no extra area on the page users can access in which to place a description. The other challenge is for content where the text is rasterized as part of the image, which can be unavoidable for content where the text is hand-drawn or part of the image.</p>

                <p>Image descriptions and alternative text do have limits in their ability to translate image content to text, those limitations include the ability to adequately map the flow of action on a page to text, or translation of visual effects to textual equivalents. Work continues in this area to improve this experience, and we will note gaps in the sections below.</p>

            </section>

            <section id="images-alt-text">
                <h4>Alternative text and image descriptions</h4>

                <p>Describing images within a fixed layout book will somewhat depend on the type of book these images are within. For example describing a childrens picture book will be quite different than if this is a fixed layout graphic novel such as a comic book.</p>

                <aside class="ednote">
                    For the latest best practices regarding image descriptions it is recommended to visit the <a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/fxl/img.html">DAISY Knowledge Base</a> as sections from their fixed layout image descriptions has been copied here.

            </section>

            <section id="images-complex-desc">
                <h4>Complex image descriptions</h4>

                <p>Depending on the complexity of the image this may require complex description with one of the following formats:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G74">WCAG Technique: Providing a long description in text near the non-text content, with a reference to the location of the long description in the short description</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G73">WCAG Technique: Providing a long description in another location with a link to it that is immediately adjacent to the non-text content</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G92">WCAG Technique: Providing long description for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/images-desc.html#ex-02">DAISY's Example 2: Extended description in details</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/images-desc.html#ex-04">DAISY's Example 4:  Hidden description</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>If an image splits over two pages, put the full image description of both images in the first image and in the second image reference back to the first. See <a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/fxl/spreads.html">Multiple Page Spreads</a>.</p>

                <p>If there are a group of images in sequence, you only have to describe details in the first image. In the proceeding images only mention what has changed.</p>

                <p>Not all details are needed in writing alternative text for images, and what you do describe relies heavily on context. For example, if the image is described in the surrounding text, you only need to briefly describe it in the alternative text.</p>

                <h3>Useful resources for image descriptions</h3>

        <section id="navigation">
            <h3>Navigation</h3>

            <p>Effective navigation of fixed layout EPUB can be as important for accessibility as it is for reflowable EPUB. Many of the EPUB accessibility features found in reflowable EPUB can still be used in fixed layout.</p>

            <section id="navigation-epub">
                <h4>EPUB navigation document</h4>

                <blockquote>The EPUB navigation document is a mandatory component of an EPUB Package. It allows EPUB authors to include a human- and machine-readable global navigation layer, thereby ensuring increased usability and accessibility for the user. - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-intro">EPUB 3.3 Section 7.1</a></blockquote>                
            
                <section id="navigation-epub-toc">
                    <h5>Table of contents</h5>

                    <p>Longer and more complex visual publications often have a table of contents spanning several EPUB pages, and must have an additional table of contents for the navigation.</p>

                    <p>A navigation document is a requirement of EPUB; it is recommended to add additional levels of content and structure to the table of contents for accessibility. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-toc">EPUB 3.3 Section 7.4.2 The toc nav element</a></p>
                </section>

                <section id="navigation-epub-pagelist">
                    <h5>Page lists</h5>

                    <p>Because each page of a fixed layout EPUB is a separate HTML document, a page list can be generated relatively easily and will be created automatically from commonly used fixed layout creation applications. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-pagelist">EPUB 3.3 Section 7.4.3 The page-list nav element</a>.</p>

                    <h5>Landmarks</h5>

                    <p>The navigation of fixed layout EPUB can be further increased by adding section markers and landmarks to identify major sections of the publication. e.g. cover image, table of contents, and the start of the main body matter. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-nav-landmarks">EPUB 3.3 Section 7.4.4 The landmarks nav element</a>.</p>

        <section id="legibility">
            <h3>Legibility</h3>

            <p>The legibility, or readability, of fixed layout content is an important contributing factor to its accessibility, particularly for users with low vision, cognitive, or learning disabilities. As text in a fixed layout document is unalterable, it is important to consider best practices in putting together clear, legible documents. EPUB creators are reminded that ebooks can be read on a number of different screen sizes and devices, many that will be smaller than the printed version of the page. Designs for fixed layout content should take into account these smaller screen sizes and their impact on legibility and layout. This section will focus on what to consider when constructing more legible fixed layout publications.</p>

            <section id="legibility-fonts">
                <h4>Font selection</h4>

                <p>There is no single font that meets the legibility needs of all users, but considering certain font characteristics to increase legibility is possible. When planning font selections in fixed layout publications, consider the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Font sizing</li>
                    <li>Font weight</li>
                    <li>Font face or style</li>
                </ul>

                <section id="legibility-fonts-sizing">
                    <h5>Font sizing</h5>

                    <p>There is no font size guideline in WCAG [[wcag2]], however the standard default font size in most desktop and mobile browsers is 16pt for body text (I.e. in a <code>p</code> element). This size is sufficient for most content, and headings should be based off of it by using <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> sizing in CSS [[css2]]. If content contains a great deal of text, it is also recommended to consider a larger body font size like 18pt to ensure readability.</p>

                    <p>EPUB creators should also ensure font size patterns are consistent throughout the content, to assist users in differentiating and contextualizing the content.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="legibility-fonts-weight">
                    <h5>Font weight</h5>

                    <p>Depending on the chosen font, it might be necessary to consider the weight of the font to make it more legible. A font weight of 400 is considered normal or regular, but depending on the font face, may be too light. A font that is too light can disappear into the background of a page, especially if factors like clarity or contrast are not considered. A font weight of 700 is considered bold, and would be more readable, but overusing a bold typeface can present its own issues for legibility.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="legibility-fonts-face">
                    <h5>Font face</h5>

                    <p>Selecting a font face for your content can depend on a number of factors. When choosing a font for fixed layout content it is important for EPUB creators to consider readability because a user will not be able to alter the font face to suit their needs or preferences. </p>

                    <p>One of the most important factors for the readability of fonts relates to character differentiation. Character differentiation in a font is a strong indicator of readability, specifically for characters that have similar shapes in a font face. In the Latin alphabet, letters like <strong>I</strong> and <strong>l</strong>, <strong>b</strong> and <strong>d</strong>, or <strong>a</strong> <strong>o</strong> and <strong>e</strong> can look very similar to one another depending on the style of the font. The same issue is possible in fonts for other alphabets, particularly when glyphs are similar in appearance or use similar elements. </p>
                </section>
            </section>

            <section id="legibility-color">
                <h4>Color contrast</h4>

                <p>WCAG 2 [[wcag2]] specifies that the color contrast should meet certain ratios depending on its size and weight.</p>

                <p>Body text, or text that is less than 18pt (or 14pt bold) in size must have a contrast of at least 4.5:1 to the background.</p>

                <p>Large scale text, text that is over 18pt (or 14pt bold) must have a contrast of at least 3:1 to the background.</p>

                <p>It is recommended text be placed on a solid background or one that is significantly muted in order to increase the legibility of the text.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="legibility-layout">
                <h4>Text layout</h4>

                <p>The layout of text in a fixed-layout publication is also important when considering legibility. As outlined in the <a href="#reading-order">Reading Order</a> section, the order of content on the page, and the order in code should match. When laying out a page in a fixed layout document, consider the order the reader should follow, how to indicate that order visually, and any complications to the order (i.e. asides, definitions, images, etc). </p>

                <p>When constructing a page or chapter, consider the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Use headings to indicate hierarchy and flow of information (i.e. start a page with a <code>h2</code>, with subsequent sections as <code>h3</code> or other levels as appropriate)</li>

                    <li>Use consistent design patterns for supplemental content on the page so a reader will know its purpose or be able to contextualize it (i.e. definitions or questions)</li>

            <h3>Tables</h3>

            <p>The best way to create an accessible table is to present it as tabular data. This is already documented in the DAISY Knowledge Base with directions on creating <a href="http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/tables.html">semantic tagging for tables</a>.</p>

            <p>If the table needs to remain an image, another option is to use alternative text and caption or ARIA roles to describe the data in logical reading order. The caption could be used as a summary of the table, and the alternative text would dive deeper. You would start with describing what the header row is followed by what is presented in each row. You could then dive deeper and list all the data as it appears in reading order.</p>

            <p>Depending on the complexity of the image this may require complex description with one of the following formats:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Providing a long description in text near the non-text content, with a reference to the location of the long description in the short description</li>
                <li>Providing a long description in another location with a link to it that is immediately adjacent to the non-text content</li>
                <li>Providing long description for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information</li>
                <li>Extended description in details</li>
                <li>Using hidden description</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="note">
                Using hidden descriptions should be considered very carefully, as hiding the description as demonstrated in example 4 will hide it from everything except assistive technologies. People with learning or cognitive disabilities would not benefit from this technique.

            <section id="tables-aria">
                <h4>ARIA roles for tables</h4>

                <p>Provide an extended description for a table using either <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA15">aria-describedby</a> or <code>aria-details</code>.</p>

                <p>The advantage of <code>aria-details</code> over <code>aria-describedby</code> is that it allows users access to the markup of the linked description (which could be the table markup if you put it, for example, inside a details element to collapse it). The current drawback, however, is that there isn't great support yet for the attribute. And expanding details element within a fixed layout page is also likely to wreak a bit of havoc when users click on it (unless you find a way to reliably position it offscreen, but then that limits who can access it).</p>

                <p>The aria-describedby attribute's big drawback is that it turns the description into one long text string that users have to listen to. There's no way to navigate the columns and rows or have headers read out, so it's likely going to be very difficult for users to make sense of except for very simple and very small tables.</p>

        <h2>Package metadata</h2>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-fxl-package">package metadata</a> used in the EPUB is the primary method for a reading system to determine whether content is fixed layout or reflowable. In addition to identifying the pagination mode with <code>rendition:layout</code>, package metadata can also allow the EPUB creator to have some control over other display characteristics.</p>

        <p>These display characteristics include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>rendition:orientation</code> - the orientation of the book, can be <code>landscape</code>, <code>portrait</code>, or <code>auto</code></li>
            <li><code>rendition:spread</code> - the spread settings of the book, can be <code>none</code>, <code>landscape</code>, <code>both</code>, or <code>auto</code></li>
            <li><code>rendition:page-spread-*</code> - spread settings for individual spine items, can be <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>center</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The default value for the <code>orientation</code> and <code>spread</code> properties is <code>auto</code>, which means that the reading system settings or defaults take effect.</p>

        <p>It is advised that EPUB creators must not set a specific <code>orientation</code> property, as this can interfere with user device preferences in accordance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#orientation">WCAG Success Criteria 1.3.4</a>. It is especially important for users who may be unable to change the orientation of their device to match the content settings.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility features</h3>

            <p>The schema.org property <code>accessibilityFeature</code> is used to define all accessibility features within the book.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>alternativeText</code> - Images are described with alternative text</li>

            <p>For picture books with no text, or no alternative text, the way one would consume this would be completely visually so having <code>accessModeSufficient</code> of <code>visual</code> would be solely defined.</p>
