	<p>The journey to make publications accessible for all can sometimes feels like a long and winding road. It
		takes a special kind of person with strong dedication to the goal and an abundance of perseverance to
		keep going even when it seems like there are still miles to go and many hills to climb. Ben Schroeter
		was one such person, working tirelessly to help EPUB reach its potential as a universally accessible
		format. We miss him greatly and dedicate this document to his memory.</p>
