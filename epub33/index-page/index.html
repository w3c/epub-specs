                EPUB® defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB
                format provides a means of representing, packaging and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web
                content—including HTML, CSS, SVG and other resources—for distribution in a single-file container.

            <h2>About EPUB 3.3</h2>
            <p>
                EPUB 3.3 is a revision of the EPUB 3 specification, which can be considered as a successor
                to <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/">EPUB 3.2</a>. It is also the first W3C Recommendation
                of the EPUB series of specifications.
            </p>

            <p>
                EPUB 3.3 is backward compatible with EPUB 3.2, insofar as any EPUB 3.2 document is
                also valid EPUB 3.3. In other words, moving from EPUB 3.2 to EPUB 3.3 does not require any changes to
                current publication workflows.
            </p>

            <p>
                The W3C process of standardization entails a thorough review of the specifications by Member experts,
                including checking the specification’s impact on implementations for internationalization, security,
                privacy, accessibility, and conformity to other Web standards. These reviews led to a number of small
                but important technical changes such as additional features to address bidirectional text, and more
                precise specification of security related details for scripts. The standard also includes detailed
                guidelines for implementers on the possible privacy and security problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Working Group has also created a comprehensive <a
                    href="https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/index.html">test suite</a>
                that systematically tests all normative features of the specification.
