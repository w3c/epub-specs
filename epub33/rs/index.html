			<p>EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB
				format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced
				Web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
				container.</p>
			<p>This specification defines the conformance requirements for EPUB 3 Reading Systems — the user agents
				that render EPUB Publications.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="sec-introduction">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-intro-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3 standard is separated into two distinct concerns: the authoring of <a>EPUB
						Publications</a> is defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/">core
						specification</a> [[EPUB-33]], while this specification details the rendering requirements for
					them in EPUB Reading Systems.</p>

				<p>An EPUB Reading System can take many forms. It might have a visual display area for rendering the
					content to users, for example, or it might only provide audio playback of the content. As a result,
					there is no single set of rules that all Reading Systems must follow. Rather, this specification
					breaks down the rendering requirements based on a Reading System's capabilities and the features its
					supports.</p>

				<p>Moreover, this specification provides a great deal of flexibility to developers to create unique user
					interfaces, such as in their bookshelves. As a result, metadata processing requirements are often
					quite minimal, for example.</p>

				<p>So, although this specification identifies the formal requirements for Reading Systems, it is not
					possible to read this document in isolation. Developers should also familiarize themselves with the
					full content structure of an EPUB Publication to understand the complete range of information that
					is available.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A conforming Reading System is not necessarily a single dedicated program or device but might
						exist as a distributed system.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This specification uses terminology defined in EPUB 3.3 [[EPUB-33]]. These terms appear capitalized
					wherever used.</p>

				<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section links to its definition.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="conformance"></section>

			<section id="sec-intro-relations" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to Other Specifications</h3>

				<section id="rel">
					<h4>Relationship to HTML</h4>

					<p>The [[HTML]] standard is continuously evolving &#8212; there are no longer versioned releases of
						it. That standard, in turn, references various technologies that continue to evolve, such as
						MathML, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

					<p>Reading System developers must keep track of the changes to HTML, and the technologies it
						references, to ensure they keep their systems up to date.</p>

					<p>This specification does not require EPUB Reading Systems to support scripting, HTML forms or the
						HTML DOM. Reading Systems conformant with this specification are only expected to be able to
						process a conforming <a>EPUB Content Document</a>. As <a href="#sec-scripted-content">support
							for scripting and HTML forms</a> is not compulsory, a conformant Reading System may not be a
						fully-conformant HTML user agent.</p>
				</section>


				<section id="sec-overview-relations-svg">
					<h4>Relationship to SVG</h4>

					<p>This specification does not reference a specific version of [[SVG]], but instead uses an undated
						reference. Whenever there is any ambiguity in this reference, the latest recommended
						specification is the authoritative reference.</p>

					<p>This approach ensures that EPUB will always keep pace with changes to the SVG standard. Reading
						System developers must keep track of changes to the SVG standard to ensure they keep their
						systems up to date.</p>

				<p class="note" id="note-video-codecs">It is recommended that Reading Systems support at least one of

				<h2>Internationalization</h2>
				<p>A Reading System MUST process, for all <a

					<p>Because the Media Overlay is closely linked to the <a>EPUB Content Document</a>, it is very easy

						location, then this same point is located in the Media Overlay and playback started there.</p>

					<p>This same approach allows for synchronizing the Media Overlay playback with user selection of a
						navigation point in the <a>EPUB Navigation Document</a>. The Reading System loads the Media
						Overlay for that file and finds the correct point for starting playback based on the ID [[XML]]
						of the navigation point target.</p>

					<h5>Embedded Audio and Video</h5>

					<p>An <a>EPUB Content Document</a> with which a Media Overlay is associated MAY itself contain
						embedded video and audio media. The Media Overlay elements MAY point to these elements. Unlike
						text and images, video and audio media have an intrinsic duration. Consequently, when a Reading
						System renders the synchronization described by a Media Overlay, it MUST override the default
						playback behavior of audio and video media embedded within the associated EPUB Content
						Document.</p>

					<p>Note that the rules below apply only to <em>referenced</em> [[HTML]] <a
							href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-video-element"
								><code>video</code></a> or <a
							href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-audio-element"
								><code>audio</code></a> elements within the associated EPUB Content Document. That is to
						say, the rules apply to only those elements pointed to by <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#elemdef-smil-text"><code>text</code> elements</a>
						[[EPUB-33]] within the Media Overlay (i.e., via the <code>src</code> attribute). These rules do
						not apply to embedded media not referenced by Media Overlay elements.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Reading Systems MUST deactivate the public playback interface for all referenced audio
								and video media embedded within an EPUB Content Document (typically: play/pause control,
								time slider, volume level, etc.). This behavior avoids interference between the
								scheduled playback sequence defined by the Media Overlay, and the arbitrary playback
								behavior due to user interaction or script execution. As a result, when the Reading
								System is in playback mode, it SHOULD:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>Hide the individual video/audio UI controls from the page, which overrides the
										default behavior defined by the [[HTML]] <a
											href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#attr-media-controls"
												><code>controls</code> attribute</a>.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Prevent scripts embedded within the EPUB Content Document from invoking the
										JavaScript audio/video playback API (i.e., authored as part of the default
										behavior).</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Reading Systems MUST initialize all referenced audio and video media embedded within an
								EPUB Content Document to their "stopped" state, and ready them to play from the
								zero-position within their content stream (possibly displaying the image specified using
								the [[HTML]] <a
									href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-video-element"
										><code>poster</code></a> attribute). This requirement overrides the default
								behavior defined by the [[HTML]] <a
									href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-video-element"
										><code>autoplay</code></a> attribute.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>When an EPUB Content Document element becomes active, the CSS Style Sheet visual
								highlighting rules apply regardless of the content type referred to by that element's
									<code>src</code> attribute (e.g., the CSS class name defined by the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#active-class"><code>active-class</code>
									metadata property</a> [[EPUB-33]] SHOULD be applied to visible video and audio
								player controls within the host EPUB Content Document).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>In addition to the default behavior of Media Overlay activation for textual fragments and
								images, audio and video playback MUST be started and stopped according to the duration
								implied by the authored Media Overlay synchronization (as per the standard [[SMIL3]]
								timing model). There are two possible scenarios:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>When a Media Overlay <code>text</code> element has no <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#elemdef-smil-audio"
											><code>audio</code></a> [[EPUB-33]] sibling within its <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#elemdef-smil-par"><code>par</code></a>
										[[EPUB-33]] parent container, the referenced EPUB Content Document audio or
										video media MUST play until it ends, at which point the <code>text</code>
										element's lifespan terminates. In this case, the implicit duration of the
											<code>text</code> element (and by inference, of the parent <code>par</code>
										container) is that of the referenced audio or video clip.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>When a Media Overlay <code>text</code> element has an <code>audio</code> sibling
										within its <code>par</code> parent container, Reading Systems MUST constrain the
										playback duration of the referenced EPUB Content Document audio or video media
										by the duration of the <code>audio</code> sibling. In this case, the actual
										duration of the parent <code>par</code> container is that of the child audio
										clip, regardless of the duration of the video or audio media pointed to by the
											<code>text</code> element. This behavior can result in embedded video or
										audio media ending playback prematurely (before reaching its full duration), or
										ending before the playback of the parallel Media Overlay <code>audio</code> is
										finished (in which case the last-played video frame SHOULD remain visible until
										the parent <code>par</code> container finally ends). This behavior is equivalent
										of the Media Overlay <code>audio</code> element implicitly carrying the behavior
										of the [[SMIL3]] <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL/smil-timing.html#adef-endsync"
												><code>endsync</code></a> attribute.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, Reading Systems SHOULD expose user controls for the volume levels of
										each independent audio track (i.e., from the <code>audio</code> element of the
										Media Overlay, and from the embedded audio or video media within the EPUB
										Content Document), so that users can adjust the audio output to match their
										requirements. Note that having overlapping audio tracks is typically an
										authoring-time concern: content producers usually add a layer of audio
										information over a video track for description purposes. Reading Systems
										handling of simultaneous volume levels in any specific way is OPTIONAL.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>When a <code>text</code> element becomes inactive in the Media Overlay, and when it
								points to embedded video or audio media, that referenced media MUST be reset to its
								initial "stopped" state, ready to be played from the zero-position within their content
								stream (possibly displaying the poster image specified using the [[HTML]] markup).</p>

					<p>The Media Overlay <code>text</code> element's lifespan corresponds to the rendering time of the

			<h2>Accessibility</h2>

			<p>The primary focus of this specification is on how to process and render <a>EPUB Publications</a> and
				Reading Systems generally have little influence over the accessibility of the underlying content that
				they render (i.e., the accessibility is determined both by the capabilities of the technologies used and
				how they are taken advantage of by EPUB Creators). So long as Reading Systems fully and accurately
				support EPUB's required technologies, there should not be issues in the content rendering itself.</p>

			<p>Where accessibility intersects with Reading Systems is in the user interface provided to users. But even
				here the specification provides a lot of leeway in terms of how to construct such interfaces as Reading
				Systems may take many forms. EPUB Reading Systems run the gamut from standalone applications to
				device-integrated programs (e.g., eInk readers) to web-hosted applications. A reading system may or may
				not even have a visual interface as auditory applications allow users who are blind to easily consume
				EPUB Publications.</p>

			<p>Due to this flexibility, this specification does not mandate specific user interfaces that all Reading
				Systems must offer. At the same time, however, it is critically important that Reading Systems be as
				accessible as possible to ensure the widest number of users can read their content.</p>

			<p>The following list outlines some of the common areas where a lack of accessibility impacts the reading
				experience for users.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Bookshelf &#8212; Ensure that the process for accessing and opening the user's content is
					accessible. For example, do not rely on a visual-only display like cover images. Exposing text
					representations of the title(s) and author(s), including the language they are expressed in, allows
					assistive technologies to properly announce the options.</li>
				<li>User Interface Controls &#8212; Ensure that all controls (e.g., search boxes, annotation controls,
					and buttons to load features such as the table of contents) are exposed to assistive technologies
					and their actions do not rely on specific modalities (e.g., they only operate through touch or a
					mouse).</li>
				<li>Search &#8212; Search access to the full text content of all EPUB Content Documents (including
					alternative text attributes, text in SVG images, etc.) is necessary to ensure users can locate
					information easily.</li>
				<li>Display Control &#8212; Provide methods for users to tailor the styling of the content to their
					preferences (e.g., to change and increase fonts, increase line and word spacing, and apply alternate
					contrasts).</li>
				<li>Zoom &#8212; Allow users to zoom the content to better size it to their needs, especially for
						<a>Fixed-Layout Documents</a>.</li>
				<li>Reading Control &#8212; Ensure that the ability to read from page-to-page and document-to-document
					does not depend on physical interaction (i.e., users of assistive technologies can read the content
					without getting trapped at the end of pages or documents).</li>
				<li>API Integration &#8212; Ensure that the accessibility tree, including support for roles, states and
					properties [[WAI-ARIA-11]], is exposed to the underlying operating system's accessibility API so
					that users can fully interact with the content when using assistive technologies.</li>
				<li>Document Object Model (DOM) &#8212; Provide access to the [[DOM]] of EPUB Content Documents so that
					users can investigate the semantics and structure used in the source.</li>
				<li>Table of Contents &#8212; Ensure that users can access the link text, including <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#confreq-nav-a-title">text alternatives for visual
						content</a>. Activating the table of contents links should be possible using different
					inputs.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The DAISY Consortium maintains an <a href="http://epubtest.org/test-books">accessibility test suite</a>
				to aid in evaluating these issues and more.</p>

			<p>In addition, although focused on browser acccessibility, the W3C's <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines</a> [[UAAG20]] provides
				many useful practices developers can apply to improve their Reading Systems.</p>

			<h2>Security and Privacy</h2>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>This section currently combines an overview of security and privacy considerations with issues
					previously cited in the specification.</p>
				<p>The Working Group intends to develop this section throughout the revision to further expand on the
					issues and provide it with a more structured narrative.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The particularity of an <a>EPUB Publication</a> is its structure. The EPUB format provides a means of
				representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content — including HTML,
				CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container. This specification does not
					<em>add</em> any new features, complex APIs, etc. This also means that, essentially, the security
				and privacy issues are reliant on the features of those formats. In particular:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>EPUB 3 allows references to remotely hosted resources from within <a>EPUB Content Documents</a>, but
					also from the <a>Package Document</a> (e.g., in a <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-item-elem"><code>item</code></a> element which allows
					both local and remote references). This is not unlike any external reference from an average Web
					site that potentially exposes users to malicious content, and the general Web security principles
					should be taken into account (e.g., cross-origin resource sharing).</li>
				<li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-package-doc">Package Document</a> allows personally
					identifiable information about an EPUB Publication's creator(s) (e.g., names, identifying URLs) to
					be included, so authoring tools could expose unexpected information if explicit author approval of
					metadata is not required.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Additionally, the security considerations that apply to XML [[XML]] and ZIP [[ZIP]] files also apply to
				the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-package-doc">Package Document</a> and the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-ocf">Open Container Format</a>, respectively. See the
				"Security Consideration" sections of the Media Type registrations for the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#app-media-type-app-oebps-package"
						><code>application/oebps-package+xml</code></a> and the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#app-media-type-app-oebps-package"
						><code>application/epub+zip</code></a> formats for further details. </p>

			<section id="sec-scripted-content-security">
				<h4>Scripting Considerations</h4>

				<p>Reading System developers who also support scripting must be aware of the security issues that arise
					when Reading Systems execute scripted content. As the underlying scripting model employed by Reading
					Systems and browsers is the same, developers must take into consideration the same kinds of issues
					encountered in Web contexts.</p>

				<p>Each Reading System must establish if it can trust the scripts in a particular document. Reading
					Systems should treat all scripts as untrusted (and potentially malicious), and developers should
					examine all vectors of attack and protected against them. In particular, developers should consider
					the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>an attack against the runtime environment (e.g., stealing files from a user's hard
							drive);</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>an attack against the Reading System itself (e.g., stealing a list of a user's books or
							causing unexpected behavior);</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>an attack of one Content Document against another (e.g., stealing data that originated in a
							different document);</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>an attack of an unencrypted script against an encrypted portion of a document (e.g., an
							injected malicious script extracting protected content);</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>an attack against the local network (e.g., stealing data from a server behind a
							firewall).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To limit the possible damage of untrusted scripts, this specification recommends that Reading Systems
					establish a unique <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#origin">origin</a> [[URL]] allocated to
					each <a>EPUB Publication</a> (see <a href="#sec-scripted-content"></a>). Adopting this approach
					isolates publications from each other, thereby limiting access to cookies, DOM storage, etc.
					Examples of Web APIs that are tied to the concept of "origin" include Web Storage [[WEBSTORAGE]] and
					IndexedDB [[INDEXEDDB]], which EPUB Content Documents can interact with via scripting. Reading
					Systems that allow users to add/remove publications from a managed library (a.k.a "bookshelf") may
					maintain the publication’s unique origin when the publication is removed and subsequently
					re-imported into the content library. Conversely, Reading Systems may create a new unique origin for
					every newly-added publication.</p>

				<p>In addition, this specification recommends the following privacy practices:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Reading Systems that support scripting and network access should also include methods to
							notify the user that network activity is occurring and/or that allow them to disable it.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>If a Reading System allows users/scripts to store persistent data, it must treat that data as
							sensitive. Scripts may save persistent data through cookies and DOM storage but Reading
							Systems may block such attempts. Reading Systems that allow users to store data must ensure
							they do not make that data available to other unrelated documents (e.g., ones that could be
							spoofed). In particular, checking for a matching document identifier (or similar metadata)
							is not a valid method to control access to persistent data.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Reading Systems that allow local storage should also provide methods for users to inspect, or
							delete that data.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Note that compliance with these recommendations does not guarantee protection from the possible
					attacks listed above; developers must examine each potential vulnerability within the context of
					their Reading System.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-scripted-content-events">
				<h4>Event Model Considerations</h4>

				<p>Reading Systems should follow the DOM Event model as per [[HTML]] and pass UI events to the scripting
					environment before performing any default action associated with these events. Reading System
					implementers should ensure that scripts cannot disable critical functionality (such as navigation)
					to constrain the extent to which a <a href="#sec-scripted-content-security">potentially
						malicious</a> script could impact their Reading Systems. As a result, although the scripting
					environment should be able to cancel the default action of any event, some events either might not
					be passed through or might not be cancelable.</p>
