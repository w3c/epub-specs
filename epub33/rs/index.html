			<p>EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB
				format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced
				web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
				container.</p>
			<p>This specification defines the conformance requirements for EPUB 3 reading systems — the user agents that
				render EPUB publications.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="sec-introduction">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-intro-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3 standard is separated into two distinct concerns: the authoring of <a>EPUB
						publications</a> is defined in the <a data-cite="epub-33#">core specification</a> [[epub-33]],
					while this specification details the rendering requirements for them in EPUB reading systems.</p>

				<p>An EPUB reading system can take many forms. It might have a visual display area for rendering the
					content to users, for example, or it might only provide audio playback of the content. Therefore,
					there is no single set of rules that applies to all reading systems. Rather, this specification
					breaks down the rendering requirements based on a reading system's capabilities and the features it
					supports.</p>

				<p>Moreover, this specification allows for a great deal of flexibility for developers to create unique
					user interfaces, and requirements for things like metadata processing are intentionally minimal to
					allow for such flexibility.</p>

				<p>So, although this specification identifies the formal requirements for reading systems, it is not
					possible to understand this document in isolation. Developers should also familiarize themselves
					with the full content structure of an EPUB publication in order to understand the complete range of
					information that is available.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A conforming reading system is not necessarily a single dedicated program or device but might
						exist as a distributed system.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This specification uses <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-terminology">terminology defined in EPUB 3.3</a>
					[[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>It also defines the following term:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>
						<dfn class="export">content display area</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The area within the [=viewport=] dedicated to the display of <a>EPUB content documents</a>.
							The content display area excludes any borders, margins, headers, footers, or other
							decoration a [=EPUB reading system=] might inject into the viewport.</p>
						<p>In the case of [=synthetic spreads=], the viewport contains two content display areas.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section links to its definition.</p>

			<section id="sec-intro-relations" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>

				<section id="rel">
					<h4>Relationship to HTML</h4>

					<p>The [[html]] standard is continuously evolving &#8212; there are no longer versioned releases of
						it. That standard, in turn, references various technologies that continue to evolve, such as
						MathML, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

					<p>Reading system developers must keep track of the changes to HTML, and the technologies it
						references, to ensure they keep their systems up to date.</p>

					<p>This specification does not require EPUB reading systems to support scripting, HTML forms or the
						HTML DOM. Reading systems conformant with this specification are only expected to be able to
						process a conforming [=EPUB content document=]. As <a href="#sec-scripted-content">support for
							scripting and HTML forms</a> is not compulsory, a conformant reading system might not be a
						fully conformant HTML user agent.</p>
				</section>


				<section id="sec-overview-relations-svg">
					<h4>Relationship to SVG</h4>

					<p>This specification does not reference a specific version of [[svg]], but instead uses an undated
						reference. Whenever there is any ambiguity in this reference, the latest recommended
						specification is the authoritative reference.</p>

					<p>This approach ensures that EPUB will always keep pace with changes to the SVG standard. Reading
						system developers must keep track of changes to the SVG standard to ensure that they keep their
						systems up to date.</p>

			<section id="sec-epub-rs-i18n">
				<h2>Internationalization</h2>

				<p>A reading system MUST process, for all [=publication resources=], the attributes that set the
					language for the documents' contents, when applicable. This includes:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the <a data-cite="xml#sec-lang-tag"><code>xml:lang</code> attribute</a> [[xml]] for all XML
						documents (e.g., the [=package document=], [=XHTML content documents=], <a>SVG content

						respective "The 'lang' and 'xml:lang' attributes" sections in [[html]] and [[svg]] for more
						information.)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Similarly, a reading system MUST process, for all [=publication resources=], the attributes that set
					the base direction for the documents' contents, when applicable. This includes:</p>

				<ul>
					<li id="confreq-rs-pkg-dir-intro"
						data-tests="#pkg-dir_creator-rtl,#pkg-dir_rtl-root-ltr,#pkg-dir_rtl-root-unset,#pkg-dir_unset-root-rtl,#pkg-dir_unset-root-unset,#pkg-dir-auto_root-rtl,#pkg-dir-auto_root-unset"

			<section id="sec-epub-rs-network-access">
				<h3>Network access</h3>

				<p>Reading systems MAY support network access to <a href="#sec-epub-rs-conf-remote-res">retrieve remote
						resources</a> and to allow [=scripted content documents=] to <a
						href="#confreq-rs-scripted-limit">communicate with web-hosted APIs and retrieve
					resources</a>.</p>

				<p>Providing network access, however, increases both the security risks to the reading systems and the
					security and privacy risks to users. These risks are often unique to reading systems and the
					platforms they run on &#8212; the browser cores that most reading systems are built on do not offer
					the same security and privacy controls as web browsers themselves. Consequently, developers need to
					use extra caution when allowing network access, and more thoroughly test that their reading systems
					are not vulnerable to attacks. More information about these risks is provided in <a
						href="#sec-security-privacy"></a>.</p>

				<p>If reading system developers allow network access, it is strongly RECOMMENDED both that they:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>notify users when network activity occurs; and</li>
					<li>let users block access to the network (e.g., disable network access for the reading system
						globally or for a particular EPUB publication).</li>
				</ul>

			<section id="sec-epub-rs-external-links">
				<h3>External links</h3>

				<p data-tests="#pub-external-links">Reading systems SHOULD open links that resolve outside the <a>EPUB
						publication</a> in a new browser instance to ensure that the browser's security and privacy
					controls are available to users.</p>

				<p>Although links to external web sites and resources are commonly found in <a>EPUB content
						documents</a>, these are not the only sources. For example, if a reading system provides access
					to <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-link-elem">linked records</a> [[epub-33]] in the <a>package
						document</a> metadata, it should similarly open the links in a new browser instance.</p>

							>potentially malicious</a> script could impact their reading systems. As a result, although
						the scripting environment should be able to cancel the default action of any event, some events
						either might not be passed through or might not be cancelable.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-scripted-content-security" class="informative">
					<h3>Security considerations</h3>

					<p>Reading system developers who also support scripting must be aware of the security issues that
						arise when reading systems execute scripted content. As the underlying scripting model employed
						by reading systems and browsers is the same, developers must take into consideration the same
						kinds of issues encountered in web contexts.</p>

					<p>Each reading system must establish if it can trust the scripts in a particular document. Reading
						systems should treat all scripts as untrusted (and potentially malicious), and developers should
						examine all vectors of attack and protect against them. In particular, developers should
						consider the following:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the runtime environment (e.g., stealing files from a user's hard
								drive);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the reading system itself (e.g., stealing a list of a user's books or
								causing unexpected behavior);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack of one EPUB content document against another (e.g., stealing data that
								originated in a different document);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack of an unencrypted script against an encrypted portion of a document (e.g., an
								injected malicious script extracting protected content);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the local network (e.g., stealing data from a server behind a
								firewall).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>To limit the possible damage of untrusted scripts, this specification recommends that reading
						systems establish a unique [=origin=] [[url]] allocated to each [=EPUB publication=] (see <a
							href="#sec-container-iri"></a>). Assigning a unique origin ensures that <a
							data-cite="epub-33#sec-scripted-spine">spine-level scripts</a> [[epub-33]] are isolated from
						other EPUB publications, and limits access to <a data-cite="html#dom-document-cookie"
							>cookies</a> [[html]], <a data-cite="html#webstorage">web storage</a> [[html]], etc.</p>

					<p>Examples of web APIs that are tied to the concept of "origin" include web storage [[html]] and
						IndexedDB [[indexeddb]], which EPUB content documents can interact with via scripting. Reading
						systems that allow users to add/remove publications from a managed library (their "bookshelf")
						may maintain the publication's unique origin when the publication is removed and subsequently
						re-imported into the content library. Conversely, reading systems may create a new unique origin
						for every newly added publication.</p>

					<p>This specification also recommends that <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-scripted-container-constrained"
							>container-constrained scripts</a> [[epub-33]] not be allowed to modify the DOM of the host
						EPUB content document and/or manipulate the containing rectangle (see <a
							href="#sec-scripted-content"></a>).</p>

					<p>Note that compliance with these recommendations does not guarantee protection from the possible
						attacks listed above; developers must examine each potential vulnerability within the context of
						their reading system.</p>

					<p>Because the media overlay is closely linked to the [=EPUB content document=], it is very easy for
						reading systems to locate a position in the EPUB content document based on the current position

						example, if a specific page number in the EPUB content document is the desired location, then
						this same point is located in the media overlay and playback started there.</p>

					<p>This same approach allows for synchronizing the media overlay playback with user selection of a
						navigation point in the [=EPUB navigation document=]. The reading system loads the media overlay
						for that file and finds the correct point for starting playback based on the ID of the
						navigation point target.</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									<p>When a media overlay <code>text</code> element has an <code>audio</code> sibling

										of the media overlay <code>audio</code> element implicitly carrying the behavior
										of the [[smil3]] <a data-cite="smil3/smil-timing.html#adef-endsync"
												><code>endsync</code></a> attribute.</p>
									<p>Furthermore, reading systems SHOULD expose user controls for the volume levels of

										media overlay, and from the embedded audio or video media within the EPUB
										content document), so that users can adjust the audio output to match their
										requirements. Note that having overlapping audio tracks is typically an

			<h2>Accessibility</h2>

			<p>Although the primary focus of this specification is on how to process and render [=EPUB publications=] it

				there are not common accessibility issues that all reading systems developers should be aware of, or

			<p>The W3C's User Agent Accessibility Guidelines [[uaag20]] provides many useful practices developers should
				apply to improve their reading systems as many browser accessibility issues have parallels in
				EPUB-specific user agents.</p>

			<p>The following list outlines some additional EPUB-specific areas where a lack of accessibility impacts the
				reading experience for users:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Bookshelf &#8212; Ensure that the process for accessing and opening the user's content is
					accessible. For example, do not rely on a visual-only display like cover images. Exposing text
					representations of the title(s) and author(s), including the language they are expressed in, allows
					assistive technologies to properly announce the content.</li>
				<li>User Interface Controls &#8212; Ensure that all controls (e.g., search boxes, annotation controls,
					and buttons to load features such as the table of contents) are exposed to assistive technologies
					and that their actions do not rely on specific modalities (e.g., they only operate through touch or
					a mouse).</li>
				<li>Search &#8212; Search access to the full text content of all EPUB content documents is necessary to
					ensure users can locate information easily.</li>
				<li>Display Control &#8212; Provide methods for users to tailor the styling of the content to their
					preferences (e.g., to change and increase fonts, increase line and word spacing, and apply alternate
					contrasts).</li>
				<li>Zoom &#8212; Allow users to zoom the content to better size it to their needs, especially for
					[=fixed-layout documents=].</li>
				<li>Reading Control &#8212; Ensure that the ability to read from page-to-page and document-to-document
					does not depend on physical interaction (i.e., users of assistive technologies can read the content
					without getting trapped at the end of pages or documents).</li>
				<li>API Integration &#8212; Ensure that the accessibility tree, including support for roles, states and
					properties [[wai-aria-11]], is exposed to the underlying operating system's accessibility API so
					that users can fully interact with the content when using assistive technologies.</li>
				<li>Document Object Model (DOM) &#8212; Provide access to the [[dom]] of EPUB content documents so that
					users can investigate the semantics and structure expressed in the source.</li>
				<li>Table of Contents &#8212; Ensure that users can access the link text, including <a
						data-cite="epub-33#confreq-nav-a-title">text alternatives for visual content</a>. Activating the
					table of contents links should be possible using different inputs.</li>

			<h2>Security and privacy</h2>

				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The particularity of an [=EPUB publication=] is its structure. The EPUB format provides a means of
					representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced web content — including
					HTML, CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container.</p>

				<p>For reading systems, this means that the security and privacy issues are primarily based on the
					features of those formats, and closely mirror the threats presented by web content generally.</p>

				<p>Reading system developers also have a dual responsibility of both ensuring the security and privacy
					of their applications and helping limit the threats to users from the content that renders within
					them. The rest of this section explores the risk model of EPUB 3 with the aim of helping developers
					recognize and mitigate these risks.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For the risks associated with the authoring of EPUB publications, refer to the <a

				<h3>Threat model</h3>

				<p>The greatest threats to users come from the <a data-cite="epub-33#epub-threat-model">content they

					they use. Users expect that reading systems act as safeguards against malicious content and are
					often unaware that EPUB publications are susceptible to the same security risks as web sites.</p>

				<p>But although reading systems are relied on to provide security and privacy, they can also pose
					unintended threats to users depending on how information is handled. Tracking user information to
					optimize experiences is a common need, for example, but done without user permission and reading
					systems can run afoul of legal privacy requirements.</p>

				<p>This section outlines some of the key threats that reading system developers must take into
					consideration, with further details and recommendations in the following sections.</p>

					<dt>Malicious content</dt>

					<dt>Remote resources</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>[=Remote resources=] present the same risks as any EPUB publication loaded from an untrusted
							source. Even if the publisher of the EPUB publication is trusted, remote resources may be
							compromised.</p>
						<p>Calls to remote resources can also be used to track information about users (e.g., through
							server logs). Reading systems should limit the information they expose through HTTP requests
							to only what is essential to obtain the resource.</p>
						<p>The <a href="#sec-container-iri">origin</a> of an EPUB is both unknown to the EPUB creator
							and specific to each reading system implementation. Consequently, if the EPUB creator hosts
							remote resources on a web server they control, the server effectively cannot use security
							features that require specifying allowable origins, such as headers for <a

					</dd>

					<dt>External links</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Like remote resources, external links may be used to trick unwitting users into opening
							malicious resources on the web designed to exploit the reading system or operating
							system.</p>
						<p>Likewise, reading systems should also avoid exposing potentially identifying information

					<dt>User-generated content</dt>

					<dt>Collection of user data</dt>

				<h3>Recommendations</h3>

				<p>The strongest measure that reading system developers can take for privacy is to specify the data they
					intend to collect and use about the user and/or their reading behavior and seek the consent of users
					to obtain it. They should also allow personalization and control over this information.</p>

				<p>If a reading system allows users to store persistent data, especially personally identifiable
					information, it must treat that data as sensitive.</p>

				<p>It is understood that the collection of some user data may be required for the sale, delivery, and
					operation of an EPUB publication, particularly on platforms where the sale of an EPUB publication
					and the method of reading it are connected. In these cases, it is recommended that the reading
					system or retailer be clear about the data being collected, how it is used, and allow for user
					opt-outs where possible. Anonymization of data is strongly recommended for the privacy and the
					security of the user and reading system.</p>

				<p>It is also understood that user data may be required or helpful for some reading system affordances.
					In these cases, anonymization is strongly recommended. It is also recommended that reading systems
					inform users of what data is needed, what it is to be used for, and to provide methods to
					opt-out.</p>

				<p>Content processors &#8212; defined as entities that handle the ingestion of EPUB content for
					distribution, display, or sale &#8212; should also be aware of the potential risks in ingestion. It
					is advised that content processors check content for malicious content on ingestion, in addition to
					the validation steps that usually occur. This could include running virus scans, validating external
					links and remote resources, and other precautions.</p>
