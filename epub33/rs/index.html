			<p>EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB
				format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced
				Web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
				container.</p>
			<p>This specification defines the conformance requirements for EPUB® 3 Reading Systems — the user agents
				that render EPUB Publications.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="sec-introduction">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-intro-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3 standard is separated into two distinct concerns: the authoring of <a>EPUB
						Publications</a> is defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/">core
						specification</a> [[EPUB-33]], while this specification details the rendering requirements for
					them in <a>EPUB Reading Systems</a>.</p>

				<p>An EPUB Reading System can take many forms. It might have a visual display area for rendering the
					content to users, for example, or it might only provide audio playback of the content. As a result,
					there is no single set of rules that all Reading Systems have to follow. Rather, the rendering
					requirements are broken down based on the Reading System's capabilities and the features its
					supports.</p>

				<p>Moreover, a great deal of flexibility is provided to developers to create unique user interfaces,
					such as their bookshelves. As a result, metadata processing requirements are often quite minimal,
					for example.</p>

				<p>So, although this specification identifies the formal requirements for Reading Systems, it is not
					possible to read this document in isolation. Developers will also need to familiarize themselves
					with the full content structure of an EPUB Publication to understand the complete range of
					information that is available.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="conformance"></section>

			<section id="sec-intro-relations" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to Other Specifications</h3>

				<section id="rel">
					<h4>Relationship to HTML</h4>

					<p>The [[HTML]] standard is continuously evolving &#8212; there are no longer versioned releases of
						it. That standard, in turn, references various technologies that continue to evolve, such as
						MathML, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

					<p>Reading System developers will need to keep track of the changes to HTML, and the technologies it
						references, and ensure that their systems are kept up to date.</p>

					<p>This specification does not require <a>EPUB Reading Systems</a> to support scripting, HTML forms
						or the HTML DOM. Reading Systems conformant with this specification are only expected to be able
						to process a conforming <a>EPUB Content Document</a>. As <a href="#sec-scripted-content-rs-reqs"
							>support for scripting and HTML forms</a> is not compulsory, a conformant Reading System
						might not be a fully-conformant HTML user agent.</p>
				</section>


				<section id="sec-overview-relations-svg">
					<h4>Relationship to SVG</h4>

					<p>This specification does not reference a specific version of [[SVG]], but instead uses an undated
						reference. Whenever there is any ambiguity in this reference, the latest recommended
						specification is the authoritative reference.</p>

					<p>This approach ensures that EPUB will always keep pace with changes to the SVG standard. Reading
						System developers will need to keep track of changes to the SVG standard and ensure that their
						systems are kept up to date.</p>

				<section id="sec-scripted-content-security" class="informative">
					<h4>Security Considerations</h4>

					<p><a>EPUB Creators</a> and <a>Reading System</a> developers must be aware of the security issues
						that arise when scripted content is executed by a Reading System. As the underlying scripting
						model employed by Reading Systems and browsers is the same, the same kinds of issues encountered
						in Web contexts have to be taken into consideration.</p>

					<p>Each Reading System has to establish if the scripts in a particular document are to be trusted or
						not. It is advised that all scripts be treated as untrusted (and potentially malicious), and
						that all vectors of attack be examined and protected against. In particular, the following need
						to be considered:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the runtime environment (e.g., stealing files from a user's hard
								drive);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the Reading System itself (e.g., stealing a list of a user's books or
								causing unexpected behavior);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack of one Content Document against another (e.g., stealing data that originated in
								a different document);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack of an unencrypted script against an encrypted portion of a document (e.g., an
								injected malicious script extracting protected content);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the local network (e.g., stealing data from a server behind a
								firewall).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The following recommendations are provided as a guide to handling untrusted scripts:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Reading Systems must behave as if a unique <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#origin"
									>origin</a> [[URL]] were allocated to each <a>EPUB Publication</a>. Adopting this
								approach will isolate publications from each other, thereby limiting access to cookies,
								DOM storage, etc.</p>
							<div class="note">
								<p>Although domain isolation is the most effective way to secure EPUB Publications in
									Web-based Reading Systems, it is not always a realistic option. Web-based Reading
									Systems must still maintain isolation in such cases, which may require limiting
									access to scripting APIs that allow client-side data storage and access.</p>
							</div>
							<p>Reading Systems that enable scripting and network access should also include methods to
								notify the user that network activity is occurring and/or that allow them to disable
								it.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>If a Reading System allows persistent data to be stored, that data must be treated as
								sensitive. Scripts may save persistent data through cookies and DOM storage but Reading
								Systems may block such attempts. Reading Systems that do allow data to be stored must
								ensure that it is not made available to other unrelated documents (e.g., ones that could
								have been spoofed). In particular, checking for a matching document identifier (or
								similar metadata) is not a valid method to control access to persistent data.</p>
							<p>Reading Systems that allow local storage should also provide methods for users to
								inspect, disable, and delete that data. The data needs to be destroyed if the
								corresponding EPUB Publication is deleted.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Note that compliance with these recommendations does not guarantee protection from the possible
						attacks listed above; developers have to examine each potential vulnerability within the context
						of their Reading System.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-scripted-content-events" class="informative">
					<h4>Event Model Considerations</h4>

					<p>Reading Systems need to follow the DOM Event model as per [[HTML]] and pass UI events to the
						scripting environment before performing any default action associated with these events. Reading
						System implementers need to ensure that scripts cannot disable critical functionality (such as
						navigation) to constrain the extent to which a <a href="#sec-scripted-content-security"
							>potentially malicious</a> script could impact their Reading Systems. As a result, although
						the scripting environment needs to be able to cancel the default action of any event, some
						events either might not be passed through or might not be cancelable.</p>

					<p>The <code>rendition:page-spread-left</code>, <code>rendition:page-spread-right</code>, and

							<code>rendition:page-spread-*</code> specification, it MUST be honored (e.g., by inserting a

					<h4>Interacting with the EPUB Content Document</h4>

					<section id="sec-rsconf-navigation">
						<h5>Navigation</h5>

						<p>Because the Media Overlay is closely linked to the <a>EPUB Content Document</a>, it is very
							easy for Reading Systems to locate a position in the EPUB Content Document based on the
							current position in the Media Overlay playback. If the user pauses synchronized playback and
							navigates to a different part of the <a>EPUB Publication</a>, synchronized playback MUST
							resume at that point. For example, if a specific page number in the EPUB Content Document is
							the desired location, then this same point is located in the Media Overlay and playback
							started there.</p>

						<p>This same approach allows for synchronizing the Media Overlay playback with user selection of
							a navigation point in the <a>EPUB Navigation Document</a>. The Reading System loads the
							Media Overlay for that file and finds the correct point for starting playback based on the
							ID [[!XML]] of the navigation point target.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>A Media Overlay Document can be associated directly with a Navigation Document in order
								to provide synchronized playback of its contents, regardless of whether the <a>XHTML
									Content Document</a> in which it resides is included in the <a>spine</a>. See <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-nav-doc"><em>EPUB Navigation

						<div class="note" id="note-table-reading-mode">
							<p>Media Overlay Document elements can be associated with EPUB Content Document structures
								such as tables. Reading Systems need to ensure that Media Overlay playback remains
								synchronized with user navigation of table rows and cells. The Reading System might also
								play the corresponding table header preceding the contents of the cell.</p>
						</div>

					</section>

					<section id="sec-embedded-media">
						<h5>Embedded Audio and Video</h5>

						<p> An <a>EPUB Content Document</a> with which a Media Overlay is associated MAY itself contain
							embedded video and audio media, which MAY be pointed to by Media Overlay elements. Unlike
							text and images, video and audio media have an intrinsic duration. Consequently, when a
							Reading System renders the synchronization described by a Media Overlay, the default
							playback behavior of audio and video media embedded within the associated EPUB Content
							Document MUST be overridden.</p>

						<p>Note that the rules below apply only to <em>referenced</em> [[!HTML]] <a
								href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-video-element"
									><code>video</code></a> or <a
								href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-audio-element"
									><code>audio</code></a> elements within the associated EPUB Content Document. That
							is to say, the rules apply to only those elements pointed to by <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#elemdef-smil-text"><code>text</code> elements</a>
							[[!EPUB-33]] within the Media Overlay (i.e., via the <code>src</code> attribute). Embedded
							media that is not referenced by Media Overlay elements is not subject to these rules.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>All referenced audio and video media embedded within an EPUB Content Document MUST
									have their public playback interface deactivated (typically: play/pause control,
									time slider, volume level, etc.). This behavior is necessary to avoid interference
									between the scheduled playback sequence defined by the Media Overlay, and the
									arbitrary playback behavior due to user interaction or script execution. As a
									result, when the Reading System is in playback mode, it SHOULD:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>Hide the individual video/audio UI controls from the page, which overrides
											the default behavior defined by the [[!HTML]] <a
												href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#attr-media-controls"
													><code>controls</code> attribute</a>.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Prevent scripts embedded within the EPUB Content Document from invoking the
											JavaScript audio/video playback API (i.e., authored as part of the default
											behavior). It is RECOMMENDED that content producers avoid publishing
											embedded scripts dedicated to controlling the playback of embedded
											audio/video media. The published Media Overlay can then retain full control
											of the synchronized presentation without any risk of interference from
											script-enabled custom behaviors.</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>All referenced audio and video media embedded within an EPUB Content Document MUST be
									initialized to their "stopped" state, and be ready to be played from the
									zero-position within their content stream (possibly displaying the image specified
									using the [[!HTML]] <a
										href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-video-element"
											><code>poster</code></a> attribute). This requirement overrides the default
									behavior defined by the [[!HTML]] <a
										href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-video-element"
											><code>autoplay</code></a> attribute.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>When an EPUB Content Document element becomes active, the CSS Style Sheet visual
									highlighting rules apply regardless of the content type referred to by that
									element's <code>src</code> attribute (e.g., the CSS class name defined by the <a
										href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#active-class"><code>active-class</code>
										metadata property</a> [[!EPUB-33]] SHOULD be applied to visible video and audio
									player controls within the host EPUB Content Document).</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>In addition to the default behavior of Media Overlay activation for textual fragments
									and images, audio and video playback MUST be started and stopped according to the
									duration implied by the authored Media Overlay synchronization (as per the standard
									[[!SMIL3]] timing model). There are two possible scenarios:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>When a Media Overlay <code>text</code> element has no <a
												href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#elemdef-smil-audio"
													><code>audio</code></a> [[!EPUB-33]] sibling within its <a
												href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#elemdef-smil-par"
												><code>par</code></a> [[!EPUB-33]] parent container, the referenced EPUB
											Content Document audio or video media MUST play until it ends, at which
											point the <code>text</code> element's lifespan terminates. In this case, the
											implicit duration of the <code>text</code> element (and by inference, of the
											parent <code>par</code> container) is that of the referenced audio or video
											clip.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>When a Media Overlay <code>text</code> element has an <code>audio</code>
											sibling within its <code>par</code> parent container, the playback duration
											of the referenced EPUB Content Document audio or video media MUST be
											constrained by the duration of the <code>audio</code> sibling. In this case,
											the actual duration of the parent <code>par</code> container is that of the
											child audio clip, regardless of the duration of the video or audio media
											pointed to by the <code>text</code> element. This behavior can result in
											embedded video or audio media ending playback prematurely (before reaching
											its full duration), or ending before the playback of the parallel Media
											Overlay <code>audio</code> is finished (in which case the last-played video
											frame SHOULD remain visible until the parent <code>par</code> container
											finally ends). This behavior is equivalent of the Media Overlay
												<code>audio</code> element implicitly carrying the behavior of the
											[[!SMIL3]] <a
												href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL/smil-timing.html#adef-endsync"
													><code>endsync</code></a> attribute.</p>
										<p>Furthermore, Reading Systems SHOULD expose user controls for the volume
											levels of each independent audio track (i.e., from the <code>audio</code>
											element of the Media Overlay, and from the embedded audio or video media
											within the EPUB Content Document), so that audio output can be adjusted to
											match listeners' requirements. Note that having overlapping audio tracks is
											typically an authoring-time concern: content producers usually add a layer
											of audio information over a video track for description purposes. It is
											RECOMMENDED that overlapping audio situations are carefully examined and
											dealt with at production stage, as Reading Systems are NOT REQUIRED to
											handle simultaneous volume levels in any specific way.</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>When a <code>text</code> element becomes inactive in the Media Overlay, and when it
									points to embedded video or audio media, that referenced media MUST be reset to its
									initial "stopped" state, ready to be played from the zero-position within their
									content stream (possibly displaying the poster image specified using the [[!HTML]]
									markup).</p>
							</li>

						<h5>The <code>rendition:flow</code> Property</h5>

						<p>If a Reading System supports the specified rendering, it SHOULD use that method to handle
							overflow content, but MAY provide the option for users to override the requested
							rendering.</p>

						<p>The default global value is <code>auto</code> if no <code>meta</code> element carrying this
							property occurs in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#elemdef-opf-metadata"
									><code>metadata</code> section</a> [[!EPUB-33]]. Reading Systems MAY support only
							this default value.</p>

						<p>If a Reading Systems supports the <a href="#layout"><code>rendition:layout</code></a>
							property, it MUST ignore the <code>rendition:flow</code> property when it has been set on a
							spine item that also specifies the <a href="#layout"><code>rendition:layout</code></a> value
								<code>pre-paginated</code>.</p>

						<p>The <code>rendition:flow</code> property values have the following processing
							requirements:</p>

						<dl class="variablelist">
							<dt id="paginated">paginated</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The Reading System SHOULD dynamically paginate all overflow content.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt id="scrolled-continuous">scrolled-continuous</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The Reading System SHOULD render all Content Documents such that overflow content is
									scrollable, and the EPUB Publication SHOULD be presented as one continuous scroll
									from spine item to spine item (except where <a
										href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#layout-property-flow-overrides">locally
										overridden</a> [[!EPUB-33]]).</p>
							</dd>
							<dt id="scrolled-doc">scrolled-doc</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The Reading System SHOULD render all Content Documents such that overflow content is
									scrollable, and each spine item SHOULD be presented as a separate scrollable
									document.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt id="auto">auto</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>The Reading System MAY render overflow content using its default method or a user
									preference, whichever is applicable.</p>
							</dd>
						</dl>

						<p>For the <code>rendition:flow-scrolled-continuous</code> property, the scroll direction is
							defined relative to the block flow direction of the root element of the XHTML Content
							Document referenced by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#elemdef-spine-itemref"
									><code>itemref</code> element</a> [[!EPUB-33]]. The scroll direction is vertical if
							the block flow direction is downward (top-to-bottom). It is horizontal if the block flow
							direction of the root element is rightward (left-to-right) or leftward (right-to-left).</p>
					</section>

					<section id="align-x-center">
						<h5>The <code>rendition:align-x-center</code> Property</h5>

						<p>When the <a href="#align-x-center"><code>rendition:align-x-center</code> property</a> is set
							on a spine item, Reading Systems SHOULD render the content centered horizontally within the
								<a>Viewport</a> or spread, as applicable. This property does not affect the rendering of
							the spine item, only the placement of the resulting content box.</p>

						<p>For reflowable content, Reading Systems that support this property MUST center each virtual
							page.</p>

						<p>This version of this specification does not define a default rendering behavior when this
							property is not supported or specified. Reading Systems MAY render spine items by their own
							design.</p>

			<h2>Security and Privacy</h2>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>This is a very initial draft intended only as a starting point. It is inspired by the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#security-privacy">relevant section of the Publication
						Manifest</a> specification. It will require more work.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The particularity of an <a>EPUB Publication</a> is its structure. The EPUB format provides a means of
				representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content — including HTML,
				CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container. This specification does not
					<em>add</em> any new features, APIs, etc. This also means that, essentially, the security and
				privacy issues are reliant on the features of those formats. In particular:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>EPUB 3 allows references to remotely hosted resources from within <a>EPUB Content Documents</a>, but
					also from the <a>Package Document</a> (e.g., in a <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-item-elem"><code>item</code></a> element which allows
					both local and remote references). This is not unlike any external reference from an average Web
					site that potentially exposes users to malicious content, and the general Web security principles
					should be taken into account (e.g., cross-origin resource sharing).</li>
				<li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-package-doc">Package Document</a> allows personally
					identifiable information about an EPUB Publication's creator(s) (e.g., names, identifying URLs) to
					be included, so authoring tools could expose unexpected information if explicit author approval of
					metadata is not required.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Additionally, the security considerations that apply to XML [[XML]] and ZIP [[ZIP]] files also apply to
				the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-package-doc">Package Document</a> and the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-ocf">Open Container Format</a>, respectively. See the
				"Security Consideration" sections of the Media Type registrations for the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#app-media-type-app-oebps-package"
						><code>application/oebps-package+xml</code></a> and the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#app-media-type-app-oebps-package"
						><code>application/epub+zip</code></a> formats for further details. </p>
