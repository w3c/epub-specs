			<p>EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB
				format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced
				web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
				container.</p>
			<p>This specification defines the conformance requirements for EPUB 3 reading systems — the user agents that

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-intro-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The EPUB 3 standard is separated into two distinct concerns: the authoring of [=EPUB publications=]
					is defined in the <a data-cite="epub-33#">core specification</a> [[epub-33]], while this
					specification details the rendering requirements for them in [=EPUB reading system=].</p>

				<p>An EPUB reading system can take many forms. It might have a visual display area for rendering the
					content to users, for example, or it might only provide audio playback of the content. Therefore,
					there is no single set of rules that applies to all reading systems. Rather, this specification
					breaks down the rendering requirements based on a reading system's capabilities and the features it
					supports.</p>

				<p>Moreover, this specification allows for a great deal of flexibility for developers to create unique
					user interfaces, and requirements for things like metadata processing are intentionally minimal to
					allow for such flexibility.</p>

				<p>So, although this specification identifies the formal requirements for reading systems, it is not
					possible to understand this document in isolation. Developers should also familiarize themselves
					with the full content structure of an EPUB publication in order to understand the complete range of
					information that is available.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A conforming reading system is not necessarily a single dedicated program or device but might
						exist as a distributed system.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-terminology">
				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<p>This specification uses <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-terminology">terminology defined in EPUB 3.3</a>
					[[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>It also defines the following term:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>
						<dfn class="export">content display area</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The area within the [=viewport=] dedicated to the display of <a>EPUB content documents</a>.
							The content display area excludes any borders, margins, headers, footers, or other
							decoration a [=EPUB reading system=] might inject into the viewport.</p>
						<p>In the case of [=synthetic spreads=], the viewport contains two content display areas.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section links to its definition.</p>

			<section id="sec-intro-relations" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>

				<section id="rel">
					<h4>Relationship to HTML</h4>

					<p>The [[html]] standard is continuously evolving &#8212; there are no longer versioned releases of
						it. That standard, in turn, references various technologies that continue to evolve, such as
						MathML, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

					<p>[=Reading system=] developers must keep track of the changes to HTML, and the technologies it
						references, to ensure they keep their systems up to date.</p>

					<p>This specification does not require EPUB reading systems to support <a
							href="#sec-scripted-content">scripting</a>, <a href="#sec-xhtml-forms">form submission</a>,
						or the HTML DOM [[dom]]. Reading systems conformant with this specification are only expected to
						be able to process a conforming [=EPUB content document=]. As support for scripting and form
						submission is not compulsory, a conformant reading system might not be a fully conformant HTML
						user agent.</p>
				</section>


				<section id="sec-overview-relations-svg">
					<h4>Relationship to SVG</h4>

					<p>This specification does not reference a specific version of [[svg]], but instead uses an undated
						reference. Whenever there is any ambiguity in this reference, the latest recommended
						specification is the authoritative reference.</p>

					<p>This approach ensures that EPUB will always keep pace with changes to the SVG standard. [=Reading
						system=] developers must keep track of changes to the SVG standard to ensure that they keep
						their systems up to date.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-rs-conformance">
			<h2>Reading system conformance</h2>

			<section id="rs-conf-req">
				<h3>Requirements</h3>

				<p>Whether a [=reading system=] has to support a feature is mentioned at the beginning of its section.
					To be conformant with this specification, reading systems MUST support all required features as well
					as all applicable conditionally-required features (e.g., to support image rendering if the reading
					system has a [=viewport=]) as defined in their respective sections.</p>

				<p class="note"> As a reading system is not necessarily a single application, but may exist as a
					distributed system, it is not always the case that reading system requirements will be met in the
					application that renders EPUB publications to users. An example is a reading system that solely
					interacts with a controlled content repository (e.g., a bookstore or library system). In this case,
					if a reading system developer can demonstrate that requirements are not applicable to the
					application (e.g., EPUB publications with duplicate [^itemref^] entries [[epub-33]] cannot enter the
					system), the reading system as a whole is still considered conforming. </p>

				<p>When supporting recommended and optional features, reading systems MUST meet all normative
					requirements as defined in their respective sections.</p>

				<p>When supporting recommended and optional features, reading systems MUST meet all normative
					requirements as defined in their respective sections.</p>

				<p>When reading system developers opt not to support a recommended or optional feature, it does not
					always mean none of the normative requirements of the section apply. In some cases, there may be
					alternative requirements when not implementing a feature (e.g., to <a
						href="#confreq-rs-scripted-flbk">process fallbacks</a> when scripting is not supported). Reading
					systems MUST meet these alternative requirements when not supporting a feature.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>EPUB publications frequently contain information not required by this specification (e.g.,
						[=package document=] metadata). Reading systems may use this additional information for any
						purposes (e.g., to improve the user interface).</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="rs-conf-error-handling">
				<h3>Error handling</h3>

				<p>Reading systems are not required to load [=EPUB publications=], or resources within them, when they
					violate content authoring or processing requirements.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="rs-conf-error-reporting" class="informative">
				<h3>Error reporting</h3>

				<p>Although reading systems are not required to report errors encountered while processing and rendering
					[=EPUB publications=] (e.g., if the dimensions of a [=fixed-layout document=] have been inferred),
					they are strongly encouraged to provide a means of accessing this information. A comparable example
					are the developer tools that web browsers provide for debugging HTML pages and applications.</p>

				<p>[=EPUB creators=], for example, can greatly benefit from having access to such processing information
					(e.g., to efficiently debug their EPUB publications). For maximum use in debugging, it is
					recommended that reading systems not only report issues they directly encounter but also issues
					reported by any applications they use (e.g., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript errors reported from a
					browser core used to render the content, or validation issues reported by <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/">EPUBCheck</a>).</p>

				<p>It is not expected that error reporting will be an intrusive experience that affects the general
					reading experience for users. Rather, reporting information could, for example, be selectively
					activated from a settings menu so that it does not bother users unnecessarily.</p>

						href="#confreq-rs-scripted-limit">communicate with web-hosted APIs and retrieve

				<p>Providing network access, however, increases both the security risks to the reading systems and the
					security and privacy risks to users. These risks are often unique to reading systems and the
					platforms they run on &#8212; the browser cores that most reading systems are built on do not offer
					the same security and privacy controls as web browsers themselves. Consequently, developers need to
					use extra caution when allowing network access, and more thoroughly test that their reading systems
					are not vulnerable to attacks. More information about these risks is provided in <a
						href="#sec-security-privacy"></a>.</p>

				<p>If reading system developers allow network access, it is RECOMMENDED both that they:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>notify users when network activity occurs; and</li>
					<li>let users block access to the network (e.g., disable network access for the reading system
						globally or for a particular EPUB publication).</li>

				</section>

				<section id="sec-scripted-content-security" class="informative">
					<h3>Security considerations</h3>

					<p>Reading system developers who also support scripting must be aware of the security issues that
						arise when reading systems execute scripted content. As the underlying scripting model employed
						by reading systems and browsers is the same, developers must take into consideration the same
						kinds of issues encountered in web contexts.</p>

					<p>Each reading system must establish if it can trust the scripts in a particular document. Reading
						systems should treat all scripts as untrusted (and potentially malicious), and developers should
						examine all vectors of attack and protect against them. In particular, developers should
						consider the following:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the runtime environment (e.g., stealing files from a user's hard
								drive);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the reading system itself (e.g., stealing a list of a user's books or
								causing unexpected behavior);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack of one [=EPUB content document=] against another (e.g., stealing data that
								originated in a different document);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack of an unencrypted script against an encrypted portion of a document (e.g., an
								injected malicious script extracting protected content);</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>an attack against the local network (e.g., stealing data from a server behind a
								firewall).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>To limit the possible damage of untrusted scripts, this specification recommends that reading
						systems establish a unique <a data-cite="html#origin">origin</a> [[html]] allocated to each
						[=EPUB publication=] (see <a href="#sec-container-iri"></a>). Assigning a unique origin ensures
						that <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-scripted-spine">spine-level scripts</a> [[epub-33]] are isolated
						from other EPUB publications, and limits access to <a data-cite="html#dom-document-cookie"
							>cookies</a> [[html]], <a data-cite="html#webstorage">web storage</a> [[html]], etc.</p>

					<p>Examples of web APIs that are tied to the concept of "origin" include web storage [[html]] and
						IndexedDB [[indexeddb]], which EPUB content documents can interact with via scripting. Reading
						systems that allow users to add/remove publications from a managed library (their "bookshelf")
						may maintain the publication's unique origin when the publication is removed and subsequently
						re-imported into the content library. Conversely, reading systems may create a new unique origin
						for every newly added publication.</p>

					<p>This specification also recommends that <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-scripted-container-constrained"
							>container-constrained scripts</a> [[epub-33]] not be allowed to modify the DOM of the host
						EPUB content document and/or manipulate the containing rectangle (see <a
							href="#sec-scripted-content"></a>).</p>

					<p>Note that compliance with these recommendations does not guarantee protection from the possible
						attacks listed above; developers must examine each potential vulnerability within the context of
						their reading system.</p>

								<summary>Explanation</summary>
								<p>If the <code>property</code> value does not have a prefix, then this step assigns the
									default vocabulary URL to use based on the attribute or element to which it belongs.
									When an element in the package document has more than one attribute that takes a
										<code>property</code> data type, those attributes share the same default
									vocabulary. For this reason, it is not necessary to check both the element and
									attribute to determine what URL to assign.</p>
								<p>The one attribute in EPUB 3 that does not have a default vocabulary is the <a
										data-cite="epub-33#attrdef-scheme"><code>scheme</code> attribute</a>

			<h2>Accessibility</h2>

			<p>Although the primary focus of this specification is on how to process and render [=EPUB publications=],
				it does not mandate specific user interfaces that all [=reading systems=] must offer. This does not mean
				that there are not common accessibility issues that all reading systems developers should be aware of,
				or seek to avoid in their applications.</p>

			<p>The W3C's User Agent Accessibility Guidelines [[uaag20]] provides many useful practices developers should
				apply to improve their reading systems as many browser accessibility issues have parallels in
				EPUB-specific user agents.</p>

			<p>The following list outlines some additional EPUB-specific areas where a lack of accessibility impacts the
				reading experience for users:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Bookshelf &#8212; Ensure that the process for accessing and opening the user's content is
					accessible. For example, do not rely on a visual-only display like cover images. Exposing text
					representations of the title(s) and author(s), including the language they are expressed in, allows
					assistive technologies to properly announce the content.</li>
				<li>User Interface Controls &#8212; Ensure that all controls (e.g., search boxes, annotation controls,
					and buttons to load features such as the table of contents) are exposed to assistive technologies
					and that their actions do not rely on specific modalities (e.g., they only operate through touch or
					a mouse).</li>
				<li>Search &#8212; Search access to the full text content of all [=EPUB content documents=] is necessary
					to ensure users can locate information easily.</li>
				<li>Display Control &#8212; Provide methods for users to tailor the styling of the content to their
					preferences (e.g., to change and increase fonts, increase line and word spacing, and apply alternate
					contrasts).</li>
				<li>Zoom &#8212; Allow users to zoom the content to better size it to their needs, especially for
					[=fixed-layout documents=].</li>
				<li>Reading Control &#8212; Ensure that the ability to read from page-to-page and document-to-document
					does not depend on physical interaction (i.e., users of assistive technologies can read the content
					without getting trapped at the end of pages or documents).</li>
				<li>API Integration &#8212; Ensure that the accessibility tree, including support for roles, states and
					properties [[wai-aria-11]], is exposed to the underlying operating system's accessibility API so
					that users can fully interact with the content when using assistive technologies.</li>
				<li>Document Object Model (DOM) &#8212; Provide access to the [[dom]] of EPUB content documents so that
					users can investigate the semantics and structure expressed in the source.</li>
				<li>Table of Contents &#8212; Ensure that users can access the link text, including <a
						data-cite="epub-33#confreq-nav-a-title">text alternatives for visual content</a>. Activating the
					table of contents links should be possible using different inputs.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The DAISY Consortium maintains an <a href="https://epubtest.org/test-books">accessibility test suite</a>
				to aid in evaluating these issues and more.</p>

			<h2>Security and privacy</h2>

			<section id="security-privacy-overview" class="informative">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The particularity of an [=EPUB publication=] is its structure. The EPUB format provides a means of
					representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced web content — including
					HTML, CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container.</p>

				<p>For [=reading systems=], this means that the security and privacy issues are primarily based on the
					features of those formats, and closely mirror the threats presented by web content generally.</p>

				<p>Reading system developers also have a dual responsibility of both ensuring the security and privacy
					of their applications and helping limit the threats to users from the content that renders within
					them. The rest of this section explores the risk model of EPUB 3 with the aim of helping developers
					recognize and mitigate these risks.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For the risks associated with the authoring of EPUB publications, refer to the <a
							data-cite="epub-33#sec-security-privacy">security and privacy section</a> of
						[[epub-33]].</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="epub-threat-model" class="informative">
				<h3>Threat model</h3>

				<p>The greatest threats to users come from the <a data-cite="epub-33#epub-threat-model">content they
						read</a> [[epub-33]], and the first line of defense against these attacks is the reading systems
					they use. Users expect that reading systems act as safeguards against malicious content and are
					often unaware that [=EPUB publications=] are susceptible to the same security risks as web
					sites.</p>

				<p>But although reading systems are relied on to provide security and privacy, they can also pose
					unintended threats to users depending on how information is handled. Tracking user information to
					optimize experiences is a common need, for example, but done without user permission and reading
					systems can run afoul of legal privacy requirements.</p>

				<p>This section outlines some of the key threats that reading system developers must take into
					consideration, with further details and recommendations in the following sections.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Scripting</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Malicious scripts present several attack vectors against reading systems. If local storage is
							not secure, for example, they can attempt to compromise the user's data. Provided with
							network access, they may attempt unauthorized collection of user data.</p>
						<p>More detailed discussion of these issues and how to mitigate them is provided in <a
								href="#sec-scripted-content-security"></a>.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Malicious content</dt>
					<dd>
						<p> EPUB publications may contain resources designed to exploit security flaws in reading
							systems or the operating systems they run on. Attackers may also try to gain access to
							[=remote resources=] using file indirection techniques, such as symbolic links or file
							aliases. </p>
						<p>The lack of a standard method of signing EPUB publications means that reading systems cannot
							always verify whether the content has been tampered with between authoring and loading in
							the device.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Remote resources</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>[=Remote resources=] present the same risks as any EPUB publication loaded from an untrusted
							source. Even if the publisher of the EPUB publication is trusted, remote resources may be
							compromised.</p>
						<p>Calls to remote resources can also be used to track information about users (e.g., through
							server logs). Reading systems should limit the information they expose through HTTP requests
							to only what is essential to obtain the resource.</p>
						<p>The <a href="#sec-container-iri">origin</a> of an EPUB is both unknown to the [=EPUB
							creator=] and specific to each reading system implementation. Consequently, if the EPUB
							creator hosts remote resources on a web server they control, the server effectively cannot
							use security features that require specifying allowable origins, such as headers for <a
								href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-protocol">CORS</a>, <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#content-security-policy-header-field"
									><code>Content-Security-Policy</code></a>, or <a
								href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7034"><code>X-Frame-Options</code></a>.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>External links</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Like remote resources, external links may be used to trick unwitting users into opening
							malicious resources on the web designed to exploit the reading system or operating
							system.</p>
						<p>Likewise, reading systems should also avoid exposing potentially identifying information
							about users through the traversal of links (e.g., not using tracking identifiers or exposing
							unnecessary information about the user's environment).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>User-generated content</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>User-generated content within a reading experience, for example through text areas or other
							interactive components, could pose a threat to reading system security or user privacy if
							the content is not properly secured. More details on scripting security are provided in <a
								href="#sec-scripted-content-security"></a>.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Collection of user data</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Collecting information about the user and their reading habits without obtaining their
							permission can violate their privacy, even if the information is only intended for internal
							use.</p>
						<p>Attempting to profile users based on their reading habits or through metadata in their
							publication (e.g., accessibility preferences) can expose users to unintended harms.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

				<p>Additionally, the security considerations that apply to [[xml]] and [[zip]] files also apply to the
						<a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">package document</a> and the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-ocf">Open Container Format</a>, respectively. See the "Security
					Consideration" sections of the Media Type registrations for the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#app-media-type-app-oebps-package"
						><code>application/oebps-package+xml</code></a> and the <a data-cite="epub-33#app-media-type"
							><code>application/epub+zip</code></a> formats for further details.</p>

			<section id="security-privacy-recommendations">
				<h3>Recommendations</h3>

				<p>The strongest measure that reading system developers can take for privacy is to specify the data they
					intend to collect and use about the user and/or their reading behavior and seek the consent of users
					to obtain it. They SHOULD also allow personalization and control over this information.</p>

				<p>If a reading system allows users to store persistent data, especially personally identifiable
					information, it SHOULD treat that data as sensitive and not allow access to it by third parties.</p>

				<p>It is understood that the collection of some user data may be required for the sale, delivery, and
					operation of an [=EPUB publication=], particularly on platforms where the sale of an EPUB
					publication and the method of reading it are connected. In these cases, the reading system SHOULD
					identify the data being collected, how it is used, and allow for user opt-outs (retailers may choose
					to inform users by other means, however, such as when a user creates an account on their web site).
					Anonymization of any collected data is RECOMMENDED for the privacy and the security of the user and
					reading system.</p>

				<p>It is also understood that user data may be required or helpful for some reading system affordances.
					In these cases, anonymization is also RECOMMENDED. Reading systems also SHOULD inform users of what
					data is needed, what it is to be used for, and to provide methods to opt-out.</p>

				<p>Content processors &#8212; defined as entities that handle the ingestion of EPUB content for
					distribution, display, or sale &#8212; also need to be aware of the potential risks in ingestion. It
					is advised that content processors check content for malicious content on ingestion, in addition to
					the validation steps that usually occur. This could include running virus scans, validating external
					links and remote resources, and other precautions.</p>

				<p id="security-privacy-recommendations-sideloaded-consent"
					data-tests="#sec-untrusted-consent_network,#sec-untrusted-consent_scripting">Reading systems that
					allow users to load untrustworthy EPUB publications (e.g., unsigned EPUB publications through the
					process of "sideloading") SHOULD treat such content as insecure (e.g., prompt users to allow
					scripting and network access).</p>

				<p>When processing XML documents, a reading system SHOULD NOT resolve <a data-cite="xml#NT-ExternalID"
						>external identifiers</a> in DOCTYPE, ENTITY and NOTATION declarations [[xml]]. Reading systems
					SHOULD also consider security risks related to <a data-cite="xml#sec-internal-ent">internal</a> or
						<a data-cite="xml#sec-external-ent">external</a> XML entities like, for example, DoS attacks
					also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">"Billion laughs
						attacks"</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_external_entity_attack">"XML external
						entity attacks"</a>. </p>
