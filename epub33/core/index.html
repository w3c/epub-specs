			<p>EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB
				format provides a means of representing, packaging and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web
				content — including HTML, CSS, SVG and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
				container.</p>
			<p>This specification defines the authoring requirements for EPUB Publications and represents the third
				major revision of the standard.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="sec-intro-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>EPUB 3 has been widely adopted as the format for digital books (ebooks), and this revision continues
					to increase the format's capabilities in order to better support a wider range of publication
					requirements, including complex layouts, rich media and interactivity, and global typography
					features. The expectation is that the EPUB 3 format will be utilized for a broad range of content,
					including books, magazines and educational, professional and scientific publications.</p>

				<p>This specification represents the core of EPUB 3 and includes the conformance requirements for
						<a>EPUB Publications</a> — the product of the standard. The other specifications that comprise
					EPUB 3 are as follows:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><a href="epub-rs.html">EPUB 3 Reading Systems</a> [[!EPUB-RS-33]] — defines the processing
							requirements for <a>EPUB Reading Systems</a> — the applications that consume EPUB
							Publications and present their content to users.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/latest/accessibility">EPUB Accessibility</a>
							[[!EPUBAccessibility-10]] — defines accessibility conformance and discovery requirements for
							EPUB Publications.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These specifications represent the formal list recognized as belonging to EPUB 3 and that contain
					functionality normatively referenced as part of the standard. New functionality is also added
					periodically through the development of extension specifications. Features and functionality defined
					outside of core revisions to the standard, while not formally recognized in this specification, are
					nonetheless available for use by <a>Authors</a> and Reading System developers.</p>

				<p>The informative <a href="epub-overview.html">EPUB 3 Overview</a> [[EPUB-OVERVIEW-33]] provides a
					general introduction to EPUB 3. A list of technical changes from the previous version is also
					available in the <a href="#change-log">change log</a>.</p>

				<p>An <a href="#index">index to key concepts and definitions</a> is also provided at the end of this
					specification.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-intro-spec-org" class="informative">
				<h3>Organization</h3>

				<p>This section reviews the organization of the EPUB specifications through the central product they
					define: the <a>EPUB Publication</a>.</p>

				<p>An EPUB Publication consists of one or more <a>Renditions</a> of its content, each of which is
					represented by what is called an <a>EPUB Package</a>. An EPUB Package consists of all the resources
					needed to render the content. The key file among these is the <a>Package Document</a>, which
					includes all the metadata used by <a>Reading Systems</a> to present the EPUB Publication to the user
					(e.g., the title and author for display in a bookshelf, as well rendering metadata such as whether
					content has a fixed layout or can be reflowed). It also provides a complete manifest of resources,
					and includes a <a>spine</a> that lists the sequence to render documents in as a user progresses
					through the content.</p>

				<p>An EPUB Package also include another key file called the <a>EPUB Navigation Document</a>. This
					document provides critical navigation capabilities, such as the table of contents, that allow users
					to quickly and easily navigate the content.</p>

				<p>The requirements for EPUB Packages are defined in <a href="#sec-packages"></a>.</p>

				<p>The EPUB Publication's resources are bundled for distribution in a ZIP-based archive with the file
					extension <code>.epub</code>. As conformant ZIP archives, EPUB Publications can be unzipped by many
					software programs, simplifying both their production and consumption.</p>

				<p>The container format not only provides a means of determining that the zipped content represents an
					EPUB Publication (the <code>mimetype</code> file), but also provides a universally-named directory
					of informative resources (<code>/META-INF</code>). Key among these resources is the
						<code>container.xml</code> file, which directs Reading Systems to the available Package
					Documents.</p>

				<p>The container format is defined in <a href="#sec-ocf"></a>.</p>

				<figure>
					<figcaption> The following example visually represents the structure of the EPUB format. </figcaption>
					<object data="images/epub.svg" width="350">
						<img src="images/epub.png" width="350" alt="" />
					</object>
				</figure>

				<p>The structure and containment of an EPUB Publication is only one half of the format, the other half
					being the content that gets presented to users. This content is built on the Open Web Platform and
					comes in two flavours: <a data-lt="XHTML Content Document">XHTML</a> and <a
						data-lt="SVG Content Document">SVG</a>. Called <a>EPUB Content Documents</a>, these documents
					typically reference many additional resources required for their proper rendering, such as images,
					audio and video clips, scripts and style sheets.</p>

				<p>Detailed information about the rules and requirements for the production of EPUB Content Documents is
					provided in <a href="#sec-contentdocs"></a>, and accessibility requirements are defined in
					[[EPUBAccessibility-10]].</p>

				<p><a>Media Overlay Documents</a> complement EPUB Content Documents. They provide declarative markup for
					synchronizing the text in EPUB Content Documents with prerecorded audio. The result is the ability
					to create a read-aloud experience where text is highlighted as it is narrated. Media Overlay
					Documents are defined in <a href="#sec-media-overlays"></a>.</p>

				<p>While conceptually simple, an EPUB Publication is more than just a collection of HTML pages and
					dependent assets in a ZIP package as presented here. Additional information about the primary
					features and functionality that EPUB Publications provide to enhance the reading experience is
					available from the referenced specifications, and a more general introduction to the features of
					EPUB 3 is provided in the informative [[EPUB-OVERVIEW-33]].</p>

				<p>The processing requirements for <a>Reading Systems</a> are defined in [[EPUB-RS-33]]. Although it is
					not necessary that Authors read this document in order to create EPUB Publications, an understanding
					of how Reading Systems have to present the content can help craft publications for optimal
					presentation to users.</p>

				<h3>Relationship to Other Specifications</h3>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-html">
					<h4>Relationship to HTML</h4>
					<p>This specification does not reference a specific version of W3C [[HTML]], but instead uses an
						undated reference that will always point to the latest recommendation. This approach ensures
						that EPUB will always keep pace with changes to the HTML standard. Authors will need to keep
						track of changes to HTML, and ensure that their processes are kept up to date.</p>

					<div class="caution">
						<p>As HTML evolves, it is possible that features that were valid in previous versions could
							become obsolete or be removed. It is anticipated that the W3C will make any such changes
							carefully to ensure minimal disruption for Authors, but in the case of a
							backwards-incompatible revision the use of an undated reference could be revisited.</p>
					</div>

					<p>The <a href="#sec-xhtml">XHTML profile defined by this specification</a> inherits all definitions
						of semantics, structure and processing behaviors from [[HTML]] unless otherwise specified.</p>

					<p>In addition, this specification <a href="#sec-xhtml-extensions">defines a set of extensions</a>
						to the W3C HTML document model that <a>Authors</a> can include in <a>XHTML Content
						Documents</a>.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-svg">
					<h4>Relationship to SVG</h4>

					<p>This specification does not reference a specific version of [[SVG]], but instead uses an undated
						reference. Whenever there is any ambiguity in this reference, the latest recommended
						specification is the authoritative reference.</p>

					<p>This approach ensures that EPUB will always keep pace with changes to the SVG standard. Authors
						and Reading System developers will need to keep track of changes to the SVG standard, and ensure
						that their processes are kept up to date.</p>

					<div class="caution">
						<p>As SVG evolves, it is possible that features that were valid in previous versions could
							become obsolete or be removed. It is anticipated that the W3C will make any such changes
							carefully to ensure minimal disruption for Authors, but in the case of a
							backwards-incompatible revision the use of an undated reference could be revisited.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-overview-relations-css">
					<h4>Relationship to CSS</h4>

					<p>EPUB 3 supports CSS as defined by the CSS Working Group Snapshot [[CSSSnapshot]]. EPUB 3 also
						maintains some prefixed CSS properties, to ensure consistent support for global languages.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="d46451e218">
					<h4>Relationship to SMIL</h4>

					<p>This specification relies on a subset of [[SMIL3]], from which the EPUB Media Overlays elements
						and attributes defined in <a href="#sec-overlays-def"></a> are derived.</p>

				<h3>Core Media Types</h3>

				<section id="sec-cmt-intro">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>Each <a>Rendition</a> of an <a>EPUB Publication</a> typically consists of many <a>Publication
							Resources</a>. These resources are divided into two categories: those that can be included
						without fallbacks (<a>Core Media Type Resources</a>) and those that cannot (<a>Foreign
							Resources</a>).</p>

					<p>Formats are typically only included as Core Media Type Resources when it can be shown that they
						have broad support in web browser cores &#8212; the rendering engines on which EPUB 3 Reading
						Systems are built. They are an agreement between Reading System developers and <a>Authors</a> to
						ensure the predictability of rendering of EPUB Publications.</p>

					<p>Inclusion as a Core Media Type Resource does not mean that all Reading Systems will support the
						rendering of a resource, however. Only Reading Systems that are capable of rendering the type of
						resource have to (e.g., a Reading System with a <a>Viewport</a> has to support image Core Media
						Type Resources, but a Reading System without a Viewport does not). Refer to <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/#sec-rs-conf-general">Conformance Requirements</a>
						[[EPUB-RS-33]] for more information about which Reading Systems rendering capabilities require
						support for which Core Media Type Resources.</p>

					<p>Foreign Resources come with no guarantee of rendering support, which is why they require a
						fallback to a Core Media Type Resource. EPUB Publications are designed to be fully consumable on
						any compliant Reading System, so providing a fallback is necessary to ensure that the use of
						Foreign Resources does not impact on the ability of the user to consume the content.</p>

					<p>This section lists the <a href="#sec-cmt-supported">set of Core Media Type Resources</a> and
						identifies <a href="#sec-foreign-restrictions">fallback mechanisms</a> that can be used to
						satisfy the consumability requirement.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>EPUB also exempts some [[HTML]] elements from support requirements (see <a
								href="#sec-xhtml-fallbacks"></a>). Resources referenced from these elements are neither
							Core Media Type Resources nor Foreign Resources &#8212; they do not require fallbacks, but
							they also have no support requirements.</p>

							<p>The Package Document <code>metadata</code> element has two primary functions:</p>

								<li>
									<p>to provide a minimal set of meta information for Reading Systems to use to
										internally catalogue an <a>EPUB Publication</a> and make it available to a user
										(e.g., to present in a bookshelf).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>to provide access to all rendering metadata needed to control the layout and
										display of the Rendition's content (e.g., <a href="#sec-package-metadata-fxl"
											>fixed-layout properties</a>).</p>
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p>The Package Document is not designed to provide complex metadata encoding capabilities.
								If more detailed information about an EPUB Publication is needed, metadata records
								(e.g., that conform to an international standard such as [[!ONIX]] or are created for
								custom purposes) can be associated using the <a href="#sec-link-elem"
									><code>link</code></a> element. This approach allows the metadata to be processed in
								its native form, avoiding the potential problems and information loss caused by
								translating to use the minimal Package Document structure.</p>

							<p id="core-metadata-reqs">In keeping with this philosophy, the Package Document only has
								the following minimal metadata requirements: it MUST include the [[!DC11]] <a
									href="#sec-opf-dcidentifier"><code>title</code></a>, <a
									href="#elemdef-opf-dcidentifier"><code>identifier</code></a> and <a
									href="#elemdef-opf-dclanguage"><code>language</code></a> elements together with the
								[[!DCTERMS]] <a href="#last-modified-date"><code>modified</code> property</a>. All other
								metadata is OPTIONAL.</p>

								</aside>

								<p>The Unique Identifier for each Rendition MAY differ, and a Rendition MAY include

								<p>To differentiate different versions of the same EPUB Publication, this specification
									makes a distinction between the <a>Unique Identifier</a> for an EPUB Publication and
									the <a>Release Identifier</a> that uniquely identifies a specific version of it.</p>

								<p>To identify a specific version of a packaged EPUB Publication, a Release Identifier
									can be constructed by combining the Unique Identifier with the <a
										href="#last-modified-date">last modified date</a> of the Rendition. For more
									information on the semantics and requirements of the Release Identifier, refer to <a
										href="#sec-metadata-elem-identifiers-pid"></a>.</p>

								<p>Whenever a Rendition is modified, it MUST include a new last modified date.</p>

								<p>The <a href="#identifier-type"><code>identifier-type</code> property</a> is used to
									indicate that an <code>identifier</code> conforms to an established system or has
									been granted by an issuing authority.</p>

								<aside class="example">
									<p>The following example shows how an identifier can be additionally marked as a <a
											href="https://doi.org">DOI</a> using the identifier-type property. Here, <a
											href="https://ns.editeur.org/onix/en/5">ONIX codelist 5</a> is used to

										<a>Rendition</a>. The <a href="#role"><code>role</code> property</a> can be
									attached to the element to indicate the function the creator played in the creation
									of the content.</p>

								<aside class="example">

								<p>Authors MAY identify the system or scheme the element's value is drawn from using the
										<a href="#authority"><code>authority</code> property</a>.</p>

								<p>When a scheme is identified, a subject code MUST be attached using the <a

							<p>The <code>collection</code> element, as defined in this section, represents a generic

									<code>collection</code> element within a Rendition, as well as all requirements for
								its valid production and use (specifically any requirements that differ from the general

								reserved for roles not defined in EPUB, which are maintained in the [[!RoleRegistry]].
								NMTOKEN values not defined in the registry are not valid. No roles are defined in this

									<code>link</code> elements significant). However, the resulting content model MUST
								represent a valid subset of the one defined in this section (e.g., specializations
								cannot introduce new elements or attributes, or re-introduce those expressly forbidden
								above). Specializations MUST NOT define collections in a way that overrides the
								requirements of the <a href="#elemdef-opf-manifest"><code>manifest</code></a> and <a

					<section id="sec-metadata-elem-identifiers-uid">
						<h5>Unique Identifier</h5>

						<p>The <a>Author</a> is responsible for including a primary identifier in the <a>Package
								Document</a> metadata that is unique to one and only one <a>EPUB Publication</a>. This
								<a>Unique Identifier</a>, whether chosen or assigned, MUST be stored in the <a
								href="#sec-opf-dcidentifier"><code>dc:identifier</code> element</a> and be referenced as
							the Unique Identifier in the <a href="#elemdef-opf-package"><code>package</code> element</a>
							<a href="#attrdef-package-unique-identifier"><code>unique-identifier</code>
							attribute</a>.</p>

						<p>Although not static, changes to the Unique Identifier for an EPUB Publication SHOULD be made
							as infrequently as possible. New identifiers SHOULD NOT be issued when updating metadata,
							fixing errata or making other minor changes to the EPUB Publication.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-metadata-elem-identifiers-pid">
						<h5>Release Identifier</h5>

						<p>The <a>Unique Identifier</a> of an <a>EPUB Publication</a> typically SHOULD NOT change with
							each minor revision to the package or its contents, as Unique Identifiers are intended to
							have maximal persistence both for referencing and distribution purposes. Each release of an
							EPUB Publication normally requires that the new version be uniquely identifiable, however,
							which results in the contradictory need for reliable Unique Identifiers that are
							changeable.</p>

						<p>To redress this problem of identifying minor modifications and releases without changing the
							Unique Identifier, this specification defines the semantics for a <em>Release
								Identifier</em>, or means of distinguishing and sequentially ordering EPUB Publications
							with the same Unique Identifier.</p>

						<p>The Release Identifier is not an actual property in the package <code>metadata</code>
							section, but is a value that can be obtained from two other mandatory pieces of metadata:
							the Unique Identifier and the last modification date of the Rendition. When the taken
							together, the combined value represents a unique identity that can be used to distinguish
							any particular version of an EPUB Publication from another.</p>

						<p id="last-modified-date">To ensure that a Release Identifier can be constructed, each
								<a>Rendition</a> MUST include exactly one [[!DCTERMS]] <code>modified</code> property
							containing its last modification date. The value of this property MUST be an
							[[!XMLSCHEMA-2]] dateTime conformant date of the form:</p>

						<pre class="nohighlight">CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ</pre>

						<p>The last modification date MUST be expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and MUST be
							terminated by the "<code>Z</code>" (Zulu) time zone indicator.</p>

						<p>Additional modified properties MAY be included in the package metadata, but they MUST have a
							different subject (i.e., they require a <code>refines</code> attribute that references an
							element or resource).</p>

						<p>Although not a part of the package metadata, for referencing and other purposes all string
							representations of the identifier MUST be constructed using the at sign (<code>@</code>) as
							the separator (i.e., of the form "id<code>@</code>date"). Whitespace MUST NOT be included
							when concatenating the strings.</p>

						<aside class="example">
							<p>The following example shows how a Unique Identifier and modification date are combined to
								form the Release Identifier.</p>
							<pre class="nohighlight">&lt;metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"&gt;
    &lt;dc:identifier id="pub-id"&gt;urn:uuid:A1B0D67E-2E81-4DF5-9E67-A64CBE366809&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;
    &lt;meta property="dcterms:modified"&gt;2011-01-01T12:00:00Z&lt;/meta&gt;
    …
&lt;/metadata&gt;

results in the Package ID:

urn:uuid:A1B0D67E-2E81-4DF5-9E67-A64CBE366809@2011-01-01T12:00:00Z
</pre>
						</aside>

						<p>Note that it is possible that the separator character MAY occur in the Unique Identifier, as
							these identifiers MAY be any string value. The Release Identifier consequently MUST be split
							on the last instance of the at sign when decomposing it into its component parts.</p>

						<p>The Release Identifier does not supersede the Unique Identifier, but represents the means by
							which different versions of the same EPUB Publication can be distinguished and identified in
							distribution channels and by Reading Systems. The sequential, chronological order inherent
							in the format of the timestamp also places EPUB Publications in order without requiring
							knowledge of the exact identifier that came before.</p>

						<p>The Release Identifier consequently allows a set of EPUB Publications to be inspected to
							determine if they represent the same version of the same Publication, different versions of
							a single EPUB Publication, or any combination of differing and similar EPUB
							Publications.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>When an <a>EPUB Container</a> includes more than one <a>Rendition</a> of an EPUB
								Publication, updating the last modified date of the <a>default rendition</a> for each
								release — even if it has not been updated — will help ensure that the EPUB Publication
								does not appear to be the same version as an earlier release, as Reading Systems only
								have to process the default rendition.</p>

					<h4>Vocabulary Association Mechanisms</h4>

					<section id="sec-metadata-assoc-intro" class="informative">
						<h5>Introduction</h5>

						<p>The <code>property</code>, <code>properties</code>, <code>rel</code> and <code>scheme</code>
							attributes use the <a href="#sec-property-datatype">property data type</a> to represent
							terms from metadata vocabularies. Similar to a CURIE [[RDFA-CORE]], the property data type
							represents an IRI [[RFC3987]] in compact form and simplifies the authoring of metadata from
							standardized vocabularies.</p>

						<p>A property value is an expression that consists of a prefix and a reference, where the prefix
							— whether literal or implied — is a shorthand mapping of an IRI that typically resolves to a
							term vocabulary. When the prefix is converted to its IRI representation and combined with
							the reference, the resulting IRI normally resolves to a fragment within that vocabulary that
							contains human- and/or machine-readable information about the term.</p>

						<p>To assist Reading Systems in processing property values, this specification defines three
							mechanisms to establish the IRI a prefix maps to:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><a href="#sec-metadata-default-vocab">default vocabularies</a> — define the mapping
									when a property value does not include a prefix;</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><a href="#sec-metadata-reserved-prefixes">reserved prefixes</a> — these mappings are
									predefined (i.e., all Reading Systems recognize them) and can be used without having
									to be declared; and</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>the <a href="#sec-prefix-attr"><code>prefix</code></a> attribute — a declarative
									means of creating new prefix mappings on the root <a href="#sec-package-elem"
											><code>package</code></a> element.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

					</section>

					<section id="sec-metadata-default-vocab">
						<h5>Default Vocabularies</h5>

						<p>A default vocabulary is a vocabulary that does not require a prefix to be declared in order
							to use its terms, and whose terms MUST always be unprefixed.</p>

						<p>As the Package Document has multiple unrelated uses for metadata terms, a single default
							vocabulary is not defined for all attributes. Instead, different default vocabularies are
							defined for use in attributes that accept a <a href="#sec-property-datatype">property data
								type</a> as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>The <a href="#app-meta-property-vocab">Meta Properties Vocabulary</a> is defined to
									be the default vocabulary for the <a href="#elemdef-meta"><code>meta</code></a>
									<code>property</code> attribute.</p>
								<p>If the attribute's value does not include a prefix, the following IRI [[!RFC3987]]
									stem MUST be used to generate the resulting IRI:
										<code>http://idpf.org/epub/vocab/package/meta/#</code></p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>The <a href="#app-link-vocab">Metadata Link Vocabulary</a> is defined to be the
									default vocabulary for the <a href="#elemdef-opf-link"><code>link</code></a>
									<code>rel</code> and <code>properties</code> attributes.</p>
								<p>If any of these attributes' values do not include a prefix, the following IRI
									[[!RFC3987]] stem MUST be used to generate the resulting IRI for them:
										<code>http://idpf.org/epub/vocab/package/link/#</code></p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>The <a href="#app-item-properties-vocab">Manifest Properties Vocabulary</a> is
									defined to be the default vocabulary for the <a href="#elemdef-package-item"
											><code>item</code></a>
									<code>properties</code> attribute.</p>
								<p>If any of the attribute's values do not include a prefix, the following IRI
									[[!RFC3987]] stem MUST be used to generate the resulting IRI for them:
										<code>http://idpf.org/epub/vocab/package/item/#</code></p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>The <a href="#app-itemref-properties-vocab">Spine Properties Vocabulary</a> is
									defined to be the default vocabulary for the <a href="#elemdef-spine-itemref"
											><code>itemref</code></a>
									<code>properties</code> attribute.</p>
								<p>If any of the attribute's values do not include a prefix, the following IRI
									[[!RFC3987]] stem MUST be used to generate the resulting IRI for them:
										<code>http://idpf.org/epub/vocab/package/itemref/#</code></p>

							<h6>The <code>rendition:page-spread-*</code> Properties</h6>

							<section id="page-spread-usage">
								<h6>Usage</h6>

								<p>When a Reading System renders a <a>Synthetic Spread</a>, the default behavior is to
									populate the spread by rendering the next <a>EPUB Content Document</a> in the next
									available unpopulated viewport, where the next available viewport is determined by
									the given <a href="#sec-spine-elem">page progression direction</a> or by local
									declarations within Content Documents. An Author MAY override this automatic
									population behavior and force a document to be placed in a particular viewport by
									specifying one of the following properties on its spine <code>itemref</code>
									element:</p>

								<dl>
									<dt id="page-spread-center">
										<code>rendition:page-spread-center</code>
									</dt>
									<dd>The <code>rendition:page-spread-center</code> property specifies the forced
										placement of a Content Document in a <a>Synthetic Spread</a>. </dd>

									<dt id="fxl-page-spread-left">
										<code>rendition:page-spread-left</code>
									</dt>
									<dd>The <code>rendition:page-spread-left</code> property is an alias for the
												<code><a href="#page-spread-left">page-spread-left</a></code>
										property.</dd>

									<dt id="fxl-page-spread-right">
										<code>rendition:page-spread-right</code>
									</dt>
									<dd>The <code>rendition:page-spread-right</code> property is an alias for the
												<code><a href="#page-spread-right">page-spread-right</a></code>
										property.</dd>
								</dl>

								<p>The <code>rendition:page-spread-left</code> property indicates that the given spine
									item is to be rendered in the left-hand slot in the spread, and
										<code>rendition:page-spread-right</code> that it be rendered in the right-hand
									slot. The <code>rendition:page-spread-center</code> property indicates to override
									the synthetic spread mode and render a single viewport positioned at the center of
									the screen.</p>

								<p>The <code>rendition:page-spread-left</code>, <code>rendition:page-spread-right</code>
									and <code>rendition:page-spread-center</code> properties apply to both pre-paginated
									and reflowable content, and they only apply when the Reading System is creating
									Synthetic Spreads.</p>

								<p>Although Authors often indicate to use a spread in certain device orientations, the
									content itself does not represent true spreads (i.e., two consecutive pages that
									have to be rendered side-by-side for readability, such as a two-page map). To
									indicate that two consecutive pages represent a true spread, Authors SHOULD use the
										<code>rendition:page-spread-left</code> and
										<code>rendition:page-spread-right</code> properties on the spine items for the
									two adjacent EPUB Content Documents, and omit the properties on spine items where
									one-up or two-up presentation is equally acceptable.</p>

									item.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>The EPUB Navigation Document is a <a href="#sec-package-conformance-nav">mandatory component</a>
						of an <a>EPUB Package</a>. It allows <a>Authors</a> to include a human- and machine-readable
						global navigation layer, thereby ensuring increased usability and accessibility for the
						user.</p>

					<p>The EPUB Navigation Document is an <a>XHTML Content Document</a>, but with additional
						restrictions on its structure to facilitate the machine-processing of its contents. [[HTML]] <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code></a>
						elements contain the specialized navigational information, which remains human-readable as well
						as allowing Reading Systems to generate navigational interfaces.</p>

					<p>But the EPUB Navigation Document is not exclusively for machine processing. Because it is an
						XHTML Content Document, it can be part of the linear reading order, avoiding the need for
						duplicate tables of contents. Content which is only destined for machine processing, such as <a
							href="#sec-nav-pagelist">page lists</a>, can be hidden from visual rendering with the <a
							href="#sec-package-nav-def-hidden">hidden</a> attribute.</p>

					<p>Note that Reading Systems might strip scripting, styling, and HTML formatting as they generate
						navigational interfaces from information found in the EPUB Navigation Document. If such
						formatting and functionality is needed, then the EPUB Navigation Document also needs to be
						included in the <a>spine</a>. The use of <a href="#confreq-cd-scripted-spine">progressive
							enhancement</a> techniques for scripting and styling of the navigation document will help
						ensure the content will retain its integrity when rendered in a non-browser context.</p>

						<h5>The <code>nav</code> Element: Types</h5>

						<section id="sec-package-nav-def-types-intro" class="informative">
							<h6>Introduction</h6>

							<p>The <code>nav</code> elements defined in an EPUB Navigation Document are distinguished
								semantically by the value of their <a href="#sec-epub-type-attribute"
										><code>epub:type</code> attribute</a>.</p>

							<p>This specification defines three types of navigation aid:</p>

							<dl class="variablelist">
								<dt>
									<a href="#sec-nav-toc">
										<code>toc</code>
									</a>
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Identifies the <code>nav</code> element that contains the table of contents. The
											<code>toc</code>
										<code>nav</code> is the only navigation aid that has to be included in the EPUB
										Navigation Document.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>
									<a href="#sec-nav-pagelist">
										<code>page-list</code>
									</a>
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Identifies the <code>nav</code> element that contains a list of pages for a print
										or other statically-paginated source for the <a>EPUB Publication</a>.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>
									<a href="#sec-nav-landmarks">
										<code>landmarks</code>
									</a>
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Identifies the <code>nav</code> element that contains a list of points of
										interest.</p>
								</dd>
							</dl>

							<p>Additional navigation types can be included in the EPUB Navigation Document. See <a
									href="#sec-package-nav-def-types-other"></a> for more information.</p>

						</section>

						<section id="sec-nav-toc">
							<h6>The <code>toc nav</code> Element </h6>

							<p>The <code>toc</code>
								<code>nav</code> element defines the primary navigational hierarchy of the given
									<a>Rendition</a>. It conceptually corresponds to a table of contents in a printed
								work (i.e., it provides navigation to the major structural sections of the
								publication).</p>

							<p>The references in the <code>toc</code>
								<code>nav</code> element MUST be ordered such that they reflect both:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>the order of the <a href="#confreq-nav-a-href">referenced EPUB Content
											Documents</a> in the <a>spine</a>;</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>the order of the targeted elements within their respective EPUB Content
										Documents.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>The <code>toc</code>
								<code>nav</code> element MUST occur exactly once in an EPUB Navigation Document.</p>
						</section>

						<section id="sec-nav-pagelist">
							<h6>The <code>page-list nav</code> Element </h6>

							<p>The <code>page-list</code>
								<code>nav</code> element provides navigation to positions in the content that correspond
								to the locations of page boundaries present in a print source being represented by the
									<a>EPUB Publication</a>.</p>

							<p>The <code>page-list</code>
								<code>nav</code> element is OPTIONAL in EPUB Navigation Documents and MUST NOT occur
								more than once.</p>

							<p>The page references within the <code>page-list</code>
								<code>nav</code> MUST be ordered so that they match both the order of the <a
									href="#confreq-nav-a-href">targeted EPUB Content Documents</a> in the <a
									href="#sec-spine-elem">spine</a> and the order of each page within its respective
								EPUB Content Document.</p>

							<p>The <code>page-list</code>
								<code>nav</code> element SHOULD contain only a single <code>ol</code> descendant (i.e.,
								no nested sublists).</p>

							<p>The destinations of the <code>page-list</code> references MAY be identified in their
								respective EPUB Content Documents using the <a
									href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code>
									term</a> [[!EPUB-SSV]].</p>
						</section>

						<section id="sec-nav-landmarks">
							<h6>The <code>landmarks nav</code> Element </h6>

							<p>The <code>landmarks</code>
								<code>nav</code> element identifies fundamental structural components in the given
									<a>Rendition</a> in order to enable Reading Systems to provide the user efficient
								access to them.</p>

							<p>The <a href="#sec-epub-type-attribute"><code>epub:type</code> attribute</a> is REQUIRED
								on <code>a</code> element descendants of the <code>landmarks</code>
								<code>nav</code> element. The structural semantics of each link target within the
									<code>landmarks</code>
								<code>nav</code> element is determined by the value of this attribute.</p>

							<aside class="example">
								<p>The following example shows a <code>landmarks</code>
									<code>nav</code> element with structural semantics drawn from the [[EPUB-SSV]].</p>
								<pre>&lt;nav epub:type="landmarks"&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a epub:type="toc" href="#toc"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a epub:type="loi" href="content.html#loi"&gt;List of Illustrations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</pre>
							</aside>

							<p>The <code>landmarks</code>
								<code>nav</code> MUST NOT include multiple entries with the same <code>epub:type</code>
								value that reference the same resource, or fragment thereof.</p>

							<p>The <code>landmarks</code>
								<code>nav</code> element is OPTIONAL in EPUB Navigation Documents and MUST NOT occur
								more than once.</p>

						</section>

						<section id="sec-package-nav-def-types-other">
							<h6>Other <code>nav</code> Elements</h6>

							<p>EPUB Navigation Documents MAY include one or more <code>nav</code> elements in addition
								to the <code>toc</code>, <code>page-list</code> and <code>landmarks</code>
								<code>nav</code> elements defined in the preceding sections. These additional
									<code>nav</code> elements SHOULD have an <code>epub:type</code> attribute to provide
								a machine-readable semantic, and MUST have a human-readable heading as their first
								child.</p>

							<p>This specification imposes no restrictions on the semantics of any additional
									<code>nav</code> elements: they MAY be used to represent navigational semantics for
								any information domain, and they MAY contain link targets with homogeneous or
								heterogeneous semantics.</p>

							<aside class="example">
								<p>The following example shows a custom list of tables navigation element.</p>
								<pre>&lt;nav aria-labelledby="lot"&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="lot"&gt;List of tables&lt;/h2&gt;

					<section id="sec-package-nav-def-hidden">
						<h5>The <code>hidden</code> attribute</h5>

						<p>In some cases, <a>Authors</a> might wish to hide parts of the navigation data within the
							content flow (i.e., the Reading System's principal rendering of the <a>spine</a> contents).
							A typical example is the <a href="#sec-nav-pagelist">list of page breaks</a>, which usually
							is not rendered as part of the content flow but is instead exposed to the user separately in
							a dedicated navigation user interface.</p>

						<p> While the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-display"
									><code>display</code> property</a> [[!CSSSnapshot]] can be used to control the
							visual rendering of EPUB Navigation Documents in Reading Systems with <a>Viewports</a>, not
							all Reading Systems provide such an interface. To control rendering across all Reading
							Systems, authors MUST use the [[!HTML]] <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute"
								><code>hidden</code></a> attribute to indicate which (if any) portions of the navigation
							data are excluded from rendering in the content flow. The <code>hidden</code> attribute has
							no effect on how navigation data is rendered outside of the content flow (such as in
							dedicated navigation user interfaces provided by Reading Systems).</p>

						<aside class="example">
							<p>The following example shows a partial <code>page-list</code>
								<code>nav</code> element. The presence of the <code>hidden</code> attribute on the root
								indicates that the entire list is excluded from rendering in the content flow.</p>

					<section id="sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection">
						<h5>Semantic Inflection</h5>

						<section id="sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection-intro" class="informative">
							<h6>Introduction</h6>

							<p>Semantic inflection is the process of attaching additional meaning about the specific
								purpose and/or nature an element plays in an <a>XHTML Content Document</a>. The <a
									href="#sec-epub-type-attribute"><code>epub:type</code> attribute</a> is used to
								express domain-specific semantics in XHTML Content Documents, with the inflection(s) it
								carries complementing the underlying [[HTML]] vocabulary.</p>

							<p>The applied semantics are intended to refine the meaning of their containing elements;
								they are not provided to override their nature (e.g., the attribute can be used to
								indicate a <code>section</code> is a chapter in a work, but is not designed to turn
									<code>p</code> elements into list items to avoid proper list structures).</p>

							<p>Semantic metadata is intended to enrich content for use in publishing workflows and for
								author-defined purposes. While it also allows Reading Systems to learn more about the
								structure and content of a document, no specific behaviors are defined for the semantics
								by this specification. Any such behaviors are Reading System-dependent.</p>

							<p>This specification defines a method for semantic inflection using <em>the attribute
									axis</em>: instead of adding new elements, the <code>epub:type</code> attribute can
								be appended to existing elements to inflect the desired semantics. A mechanism to
								identify external vocabularies that provide controlled values for the attributes is also
								defined.</p>
						</section>

						<section id="sec-epub-type-attribute">
							<h6>The <code>epub:type</code> Attribute</h6>

							<dl class="elemdef" id="attrdef-epub-type">
								<dt>Attribute Name</dt>
								<dd>

									<p>A white space-separated list of <a href="#sec-property-datatype">property</a>
										values, with restrictions as defined in <a
											href="#sec-contentdocs-vocab-association"></a>.</p>
									<p>White space is the set of characters as defined in [[!XML]].</p>
								</dd>
							</dl>

							<p>The <code>epub:type</code> attribute inflects semantics on the element on which it
								appears. Its value is one or more white space-separated terms stemming from external
								vocabularies associated with the document instance, as defined in <a
									href="#sec-contentdocs-vocab-association"></a>.</p>

							<p>The inflected semantic MUST express a subclass of the semantic of the carrying element.
								In the case of semantically neutral elements, such as the [[!HTML]] <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-div-element"
										><code>div</code></a> and <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/textlevel-semantics.html#the-span-element"
										><code>span</code></a> elements, the inflected semantic MUST NOT attach a
								meaning that is already conveyed by an existing element (e.g., that a <code>div</code>
								represents a paragraph or section).</p>

							<p>As the [[!HTML]] <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/document-metadata.html#the-head-element"
										><code>head</code> element</a> contains metadata for the document, structural
								semantics expressed on this element or any descendant of it have no meaning.</p>

						provided prefixed versions of numerous other properties. Although the CSS Working Group no
						longer recommends the use of prefixed properties, this specification has to maintain some
						prefixed properties to avoid breaking existing content. But with the minor exceptions defined in

					<h4>Scripting Contexts</h4>

					<p><a>EPUB Content Documents</a> MAY contain scripting using the facilities defined for this in the
						respective underlying specifications ([[!HTML]] and [[!SVG]]). When an EPUB Content Document
						contains scripting, it is referred to in this specification as a <a>Scripted Content
							Document</a>. This label also applies to <a>XHTML Content Documents</a> when they contain
						instances of [[!HTML]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sec-forms.html#sec-forms"
						>forms</a>.</p>

					<p id="sec-scripted-content-models">This specification defines two contexts in which scripts MAY
						appear:</p>

					<dl class="variablelist">
						<dt id="sec-scripted-content-type-spine-level">spine-level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>An instance of the [[!HTML]] <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/semantics-scripting.html#the-script-element"
										><code>script</code></a> or [[!SVG]] <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/interact.html#ScriptElement"><code>script</code></a>
								element included in a <a>Top-level Content Document</a>.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt id="sec-scripted-content-type-container-constrained">container-constrained</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Either of the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>An instance of the [[!HTML]] <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/semantics-scripting.html#the-script-element"
												><code>script</code></a> element included in an <a>XHTML Content
											Document</a> that is embedded in a parent XHTML Content Document using the
										[[!HTML]] <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-iframe-element"
												><code>iframe</code></a> element.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>An instance of the [[!SVG]] <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/script.html#ScriptElement"
												><code>script</code></a> element included in an <a>SVG Content
											Document</a> that is embedded in a parent XHTML Content Document using the

												><code>iframe</code></a> element.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>In both of the above-defined contexts, whether the JavaScript code is embedded directly in the
							<code>script</code> element or referenced via its <code>src</code> attribute makes no
						difference to the executing context.</p>

					<p>Which context a script is used in determines the rights and restrictions that a Reading System
						places on it. Refer to <a href="#sec-scripted-content-content-reqs"></a> and <a
							href="epub-rs.html#sec-scripted-content-rs-reqs">Scripting — General Conformance</a>
						[[EPUB-RS-33]] for some specific requirements that have to be adhered to (not all Reading
						Systems will provide the same scripting functionality).</p>

					<h5>Example</h5>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>Consider the following example Package Document:</p>
						<pre>&lt;package …&gt;
    …
    &lt;manifest&gt;
        …

            media-type="application/xhtml+xml"
            properties="scripted"/&gt;
        &lt;item id="inset01" 
            href="scripted02.xhtml" 
            media-type="application/xhtml+xml"
            properties="scripted"/&gt;
        &lt;item id="slideshowjs" 
            href="slideshow.js" 
            media-type="text/javascript"/&gt;
    &lt;/manifest&gt;
    
    &lt;spine …&gt;
        &lt;itemref idref="chap01"/&gt;
        …
    &lt;/spine&gt;
    …
&lt;/package&gt;</pre>

						<p>and the following file <code>scripted01.xhtml</code>:</p>

						<pre>&lt;html …&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        …
        &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
            alert("Reading System name: " + navigator.epubReadingSystem.name);
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        …
        &lt;iframe src="scripted02.xhtml" … /&gt;
        …
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>


						<p>and the following file <code>scripted02.xhtml</code>:</p>

						<pre>&lt;html …&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        …
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" href="slideshow.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        …
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

						<p>From these examples, it is true that:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>the code in the <code>script</code> element in the <code>head</code> in
										<code>scripted01.xhtml</code> is a spine-level script because the document is
									referenced from the spine;</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>the code in the <code>script</code> element in <code>scripted02.xhtml</code> is a
									container-constrained script because the HTML file it occurs in is included in
										<code>scripted01.xhtml</code> via the <code>iframe</code> element.</p>

					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>The <a>OCF Abstract Container</a> file system model uses a single common <a>Root Directory</a>
						for all of the contents. All <a>Local Resources</a> for the <a>EPUB Publication</a> are located
						within the directory tree headed by the Root Directory, but no specific file system structure
						for them is mandated by this specification.</p>

					<p>The file system model also includes a mandatory directory named <code>META-INF</code> that is a
						direct child of the Root Directory and is used to store the following special files:</p>

					<dl class="variablelist">
						<dt>
							<code>container.xml</code>
							<code>[required]</code>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Identifies the <a>Package Documents</a> that define each <a>Rendition</a> of the EPUB

					<h4>File and Directory Structure</h4>

					<p>The virtual file system for the <a>OCF Abstract Container</a> MUST have a single common <a>Root
							Directory</a> for all of the contents of the container.</p>

					<p> The OCF Abstract Container MUST include a directory named <code>META-INF</code> that is a direct
						child of the container's Root Directory. Requirements for the contents of this directory are
						described in <a href="#sec-container-metainf"></a>.</p>

					<p>The file name <code>mimetype</code> in the Root Directory is reserved for use by <a>OCF ZIP
							Containers</a>, as explained in <a href="#sec-container-zip"></a>.</p>

					<p>All other files within the OCF Abstract Container MAY be in any location descendant from the Root
						Directory, provided they are not within the <code>META-INF</code> directory.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="sec-container-iri">
					<h4>Relative IRIs for Referencing Other Components</h4>

					<p>Files within the <a>OCF Abstract Container</a> MUST reference each other via relative IRI
						references ([[!RFC3987]] and [[!RFC3986]]).</p>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>The following example shows how a file named <code>image1.jpg</code> in the same directory as
							an <a>XHTML Content Document</a> can be referenced from an [[HTML]] <code>img</code>
							element.</p>
						<pre>
&lt;img src="image1.jpg" alt="…" /&gt;
                </pre>
					</aside>

					<p>For relative IRI references, the Base IRI [[!RFC3986]] is determined by the relevant language
						specifications for the given file formats. For example, CSS defines how relative IRI references
						work in the context of CSS style sheets and property declarations [[!CSSSnapshot]].</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Some language specifications reference Requests For Comments [[RFC]] that preceded
							[[RFC3987]], in which case the earlier RFC applies for content in that particular
							language.</p>
					</div>

					<p>Unlike most language specifications, the Base IRIs for all files within the <code>META-INF</code>
						directory use the <a>Root Directory</a> of the OCF Abstract Container as the default Base
						IRI.</p>

					<p>For example, if <code>META-INF/container.xml</code> has the following content:</p>

					<pre class="example">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;container version="1.0" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:container"&gt;
    &lt;rootfiles&gt;
        &lt;rootfile full-path="EPUB/Great_Expectations.opf"
            media-type="application/oebps-package+xml" /&gt;	
    &lt;/rootfiles&gt;
&lt;/container&gt;
            </pre>

					<p>then the path <code>EPUB/Great_Expectations.opf</code> is relative to the root directory for the
						OCF Abstract Container and not relative to the <code>META-INF</code> directory.</p>

					<p>All relative IRI references MUST resolve to resources within the OCF Abstract Container (i.e., at
						or below the Root Directory).</p>

					<h4>File Names</h4>

					<p>The <a>File Name</a> restrictions described in this section are designed to allow <a>Path

							<h6>Encryption File (<code>encryption.xml</code>)</h6>

							<p>The OPTIONAL <code>encryption.xml</code> file in the <code>META-INF</code> directory
								holds all encryption information on the contents of the container. If any resource
								within the container is encrypted, <code>encryption.xml</code> MUST be present to
								indicate that the resource is encrypted and provide information on how it is
								encrypted.</p>

							<p>This file is an XML document whose root element is <code
									id="elemdef-encryption-encryption">encryption</code>. The <code>encryption</code>
								element contains child elements of type <code>EncryptedKey</code> and
									<code>EncryptedData</code> as defined by [[!XMLENC-CORE1]]. An <code
									id="elemdef-encryption-EncryptedKey">EncryptedKey</code> element describes each
								encryption key used in the container, while an <code
									id="elemdef-encryption-EncryptedData">EncryptedData</code> element describes each
								encrypted file. Each <code>EncryptedData</code> element refers to an
									<code>EncryptedKey</code> element, as described in XML Encryption.</p>

							<p>The contents of the <code>encryption.xml</code> file MUST be valid to the schema in <a
									href="#app-schema-encryption"></a>.</p>

							<p>OCF encrypts individual files independently, trading off some security for improved
								performance, allowing the container contents to be incrementally decrypted. Encryption
								in this way exposes the directory structure and file naming of the whole package.</p>

							<p>OCF uses XML Encryption [[!XMLENC-CORE1]] to provide a framework for encryption, allowing
								a variety of algorithms to be used. XML Encryption specifies a process for encrypting
								arbitrary data and representing the result in XML. Even though an <a>OCF Abstract
									Container</a> might contain non-XML data, XML Encryption can be used to encrypt all
								data in an OCF Abstract Container. OCF encryption supports only the encryption of entire
								files within the container, not parts of files. The <code>encryption.xml</code> file, if
								present, MUST NOT be encrypted.</p>

							<p>Encrypted data replaces unencrypted data in an OCF Abstract Container. For example, if an
								image named <code>photo.jpeg</code> is encrypted, the contents of the
									<code>photo.jpeg</code> resource SHOULD be replaced by its encrypted contents.
								Within the ZIP directory, encrypted files SHOULD be stored rather than
								Deflate-compressed.</p>

							<p id="encryption-obfuscation">Note that some situations require obfuscating the storage of
								embedded resources referenced by a <a>Rendition</a> to tie them to the "parent" EPUB
								Publication and make them more difficult to extract for unrestricted use (e.g., fonts).
								Although obfuscation is not encryption, the <code>encryption.xml</code> file is used in
								conjunction with the <a href="#sec-resource-obfuscation">resource obfuscation
									algorithm</a> to identify resources that need to be de-obfuscated before they can be
								used.</p>

							<p id="encryption-restrictions">The following files MUST NOT be encrypted, regardless of

								<h6>Order of Compression and Encryption</h6>

								<p>When stored in a ZIP container, streams of data with <a>Non-Codec</a> content types
									SHOULD be compressed before they are encrypted, and Deflate compression MUST be
									used. This practice ensures that file entries stored in the ZIP container have a
									smaller size.</p>

								<p>Streams of data with <a>Codec</a> content types SHOULD NOT be compressed before they
									are encrypted. In such cases, additional compression would introduce unnecessary
									processing overhead at production time (especially with large resource files), and
									would impact audio/video playback performance at consumption time. In some cases,
									the combination of compression with some encryption schemes might even compromise
									the ability of Reading Systems to handle partial content requests (e.g. HTTP byte
									ranges), due to the technical impossibility to determine the length of the full
									resource ahead of media playback (e.g. HTTP Content-Length header).</p>

								<p>Streams of data that are compressed before they are encrypted SHOULD provide
									additional <code>EncryptionProperties</code> metadata to specify the size of the
									initial resource (i.e., before compression and encryption), as per the
										<code>Compression</code> XML element defined below. Streams of data that are not
									compressed before they are encrypted MAY provide the additional
										<code>EncryptionProperties</code> metadata to specify the size of the initial
									resource (i.e., before encryption).</p>

				<h3>Resource Obfuscation</h3>

				<section id="fobfus-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>Since an <a>OCF ZIP Container</a> is fundamentally a ZIP file, commonly available ZIP tools can
						be used to extract any unencrypted content stream from the package. Moreover, the nature of ZIP
						files means that their contents might appear like any other native container on some systems
						(e.g., a folder).</p>

					<p>While this simplicity of ZIP files is quite useful, it also poses a problem when ease of
						extraction of resources is not a desired side-effect of not encrypting them. An <a>Author</a>
						who wishes to include a third-party font, for example, typically does not want that font
						extracted and re-used by others. More critically, many commercial fonts allow embedding, but
						embedding a font implies making it an integral part of the EPUB Publication, not just providing
						the original font file along with the content.</p>

					<p>Since integrated ZIP support is so ubiquitous in modern operating systems, simply placing a font
						in the ZIP archive is insufficient to signify that it is not intended to be reused in other
						contexts. This uncertainty can undermine the otherwise very useful font embedding capability of
						EPUB Publications.</p>

					<p>In order to discourage reuse of the font, some font vendors might only allow use of their fonts
						in EPUB Publications if those fonts are bound in some way to the EPUB Publication. That is, if
						the font file cannot be installed directly for use on an operating system with the built-in
						tools of that computing device, and it cannot be directly used by other EPUB Publications.</p>

					<p>It is beyond the scope of this specification to provide a digital rights management or
						enforcement system for such resources. This section instead defines a method of obfuscation that
						will require additional work on the part of the final OCF recipient to gain general access to
						any obfuscated resources.</p>

					<p>Note that no claim is made in this specification that this constitutes encryption, nor does it
						guarantee that the resource will be secure from copyright infringement. It is hoped, however,
						that this algorithm will meet the requirements of most vendors who require some assurance that
						their resources cannot simply be extracted by unzipping the Container.</p>

					<p>In the case of fonts, the primary use case for obfuscation, the defined mechanism will simply
						provide a stumbling block for those who are unaware of the license details. It will not prevent
						a determined user from gaining full access to the font. Given an OCF Container, it is possible
						to apply the algorithms defined to extract the raw font file. Whether this method of obfuscation
						satisfies the requirements of individual font licenses remains a question for the licensor and
						licensee.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="obfus-keygen">
					<h4>Obfuscation Key</h4>

					<p>The key used in the obfuscation algorithm is derived from the <a>Unique Identifier</a> of the
							<a>Default Rendition</a>.</p>

					<p>All white space characters, as defined in <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-common-syn">section 2.3 of the XML
							1.0 specification</a> [[!XML]], MUST be removed from this identifier — specifically, the
						Unicode code points <code>U+0020</code>, <code>U+0009</code>, <code>U+000D</code> and
							<code>U+000A</code>.</p>

					<p>A SHA-1 digest of the UTF-8 representation of the resulting string SHOULD be generated as
						specified by the Secure Hash Standard [[!FIPS-180-4]]. This digest is then directly used as the
						key for the algorithm.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="obfus-algorithm">
					<h4>Obfuscation Algorithm</h4>

					<p>The algorithm employed to obfuscate resource consists of modifying the first 1040 bytes (~1KB) of
						the file. In the unlikely event that the file is less than 1040 bytes, then the entire file will
						be modified.</p>

					<p>To obfuscate the original data, the result of performing a logical exclusive or (XOR) on the
						first byte of the raw file and the first byte of the <a href="#obfus-keygen">obfuscation key</a>
						is stored as the first byte of the embedded resource.</p>

					<p>This process is repeated with the next byte of source and key, and continues until all bytes in
						the key have been used. At this point, the process continues starting with the first byte of the
						key and 21st byte of the source. Once 1040 bytes have been encoded in this way (or the end of
						the source is reached), any remaining data in the source is directly copied to the
						destination.</p>

					<p>Obfuscation of resources MUST occur before they are compressed and added to the OCF Container.
						Note that as obfuscation is not encryption, this requirement is not a violation of the one in <a
							href="#sec-container-metainf-encryption.xml"></a> to compress resources before encrypting
						them.</p>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>The following pseudo-code exemplifies the obfuscation algorithm.</p>
						<pre class="programlisting">
set ocf to OCF container file
set source to file
set destination to obfuscated file
set keyData to key for file
set outer to 0
while outer &lt; 52 and not (source at EOF)
    set inner to 0
    while inner &lt; 20 and not (source at EOF)
        read 1 byte from source     //Assumes read advances file position
        set sourceByte to result of read
        set keyByte to byte inner of keyData
        set obfuscatedByte to (sourceByte XOR keyByte)
        write obfuscatedByte to destination
        increment inner
    end while
    increment outer
end while
if not (source at EOF) then
    read source to EOF
    write result of read to destination
end if
Deflate destination
store destination as source in ocf
            </pre>
					</aside>

					<p>To get the original font data back, the process is simply reversed: the source file becomes the
						obfuscated data and the destination file will contain the raw data.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The obfuscation of fonts was allowed prior to EPUB 3.0.1, but the order of obfuscation and
							compression was not specified. As a result, invalid fonts might be encountered after
							decompression and de-obfuscation. In such instances, de-obfuscating the data before
							inflating it might return a valid font. This specification does not require support for this
							method of retrieval, as it is not compliant with this version of this specification, but it
							needs to be considered when supporting EPUB 3 content generally.</p>
					</div>

				<section id="obfus-specifying">
					<h4>Specifying Obfuscated Resources</h4>

					<p>Although not technically encrypted data, all obfuscated resources MUST have an entry in the <code
							class="filename">encryption.xml</code> file accompanying the EPUB Publication (see <a
							href="#sec-container-metainf-encryption.xml"></a>).</p>

					<p>An <code>EncryptedData</code> element MUST be included for each obfuscated resource. Each
							<code>EncryptedData</code> element MUST include a child <code>EncryptionMethod</code>
						element whose <code>Algorithm</code> attribute is set to the value
							<code>http://www.idpf.org/2008/embedding</code>. The presence of this attribute signals the
						use of the algorithm described in this specification. The path to the obfuscated resource MUST
						be listed in the <code>CipherReference</code> child of the <code>CipherData</code> element.</p>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>The following example shows an entry for an obfuscated font in the
								<code>encryption.xml</code> file.</p>
						<pre>

				<h3>Media Overlay Document Definition</h3>

				<section id="sec-overlays-introduction" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>Synchronized audio narration is found in mainstream ebooks, educational tools and ebooks
						formatted for persons with print disabilities. In EPUB 3, these types of books are created using
						Media Overlay Documents to describe the timing for the pre-recorded audio narration and how it
						relates to the EPUB Content Document markup. The file format for Media Overlays is defined as a
						subset of [[SMIL3]], a W3C recommendation for representing synchronized multimedia information
						in XML.</p>

					<p>The text and audio synchronization enabled by Media Overlays provides enhanced accessibility for
						any user who has difficulty following the text of a traditional book. Media Overlays also
						provide a continuous listening experience for readers who are unable to read the text for any
						reason, something that traditional audio embedding techniques cannot offer. They are even useful
						for purposes not traditionally considered accessibility concerns (e.g., for language learning or
						reading of commercial audio books).</p>

					<p>The Media Overlays feature is designed to be transparent to <a>EPUB Reading Systems</a> that do
						not support the feature. The inclusion of Media Overlays in an EPUB Publication has no impact on
						the ability of Media Overlay-unaware Reading Systems to render the EPUB Publication as though
						the Media Overlays are not present.</p>

					<p>Although future versions of this specification might incorporate support for video media (e.g.,
						synchronized text/sign-language books), this version supports only synchronizing audio media
						with the EPUB Content Document.</p>

				<h3>Creating Media Overlays</h3>

				<section id="sec-docs-intro" class="informative">
					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>A pre-recorded narration of a publication can be represented as a series of audio clips, each
						corresponding to part of the <a>EPUB Content Document</a>. A single audio clip, for example,
						typically represents a single phrase or paragraph, but infers no order relative to the other
						clips or to the text of a document. Media Overlays solve this problem of synchronization by
						tying the structured audio narration to its corresponding text (or other media) in the EPUB
						Content Document using [[SMIL3]] markup. Media Overlays are, in fact, a simplified subset of
						SMIL 3.0 that allow the playback sequence of these clips to be defined.</p>

					<p>The SMIL elements primarily used for structuring Media Overlays are <a href="#elemdef-smil-body"
								><code>body</code></a> (used for the main sequence), <a href="#elemdef-smil-seq"
								><code>seq</code></a> (sequence) and <a href="#elemdef-smil-par"><code>par</code></a>
						(parallel). (Refer to <a href="#sec-overlays-def"></a> for more information on these and other
						SMIL elements.)</p>

					<p>The <code>par</code> element is the basic building block of an Overlay and corresponds to a
						phrase in the EPUB Content Document. The element provides two key pieces of information for
						synchronizing content: 1) the audio clip containing the narration for the phrase; and 2) a
						pointer to the associated EPUB Content Document fragment. The <code>par</code> element uses two
						media element children to represent this information: an <a href="#elemdef-smil-audio"
								><code>audio</code></a> element and a <a href="#elemdef-smil-text"><code>text</code></a>
						element. Since <code>par</code> elements render their children in parallel, the audio clip and
						EPUB Content Document fragment are played at the same time, resulting in a synchronized
						presentation.</p>

					<p>The <code>text</code> element <code>src</code> attribute references the associated phrase,
						sentence, or other segment of the EPUB Content Document by its IRI reference. The
							<code>audio</code> element <code>src</code> attribute similarly references the location of
						the corresponding audio clip, and adds the OPTIONAL <a href="#attrdef-smil-clipBegin"
								><code>clipBegin</code></a> and <a href="#attrdef-smil-clipEnd"><code>clipEnd</code></a>
						attributes to indicate a specific offset within the clip.</p>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>The following example shows the Media Overlays markup for a single phrase or sentence.</p>
						<pre>&lt;par&gt;                        
    &lt;text src="chapter1.xhtml#sentence1"/&gt;
    &lt;audio src="chapter1_audio.mp3" clipBegin="23s" clipEnd="30s"/&gt;
&lt;/par&gt;</pre>
					</aside>

					<p><code>par</code> elements are placed together sequentially to form a series of phrases or
						sentences. Not every element of the EPUB Content Document will have a corresponding
							<code>par</code> element in the Media Overlay, only those relevant to the audio
						narration.</p>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>The following example shows a basic Media Overlay Document containing a sequence of phrases.
							The <code>body</code> element acts as the main sequence for the whole document.</p>

        &lt;/par&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/smil&gt;</pre>

					<p><code>par</code> elements can also be added to <code>seq</code> elements to define more complex
						structures such as parts and chapters (see <a href="#sec-media-overlays-structure"></a>).</p>

					<h4>Relationship to the EPUB Content Document</h4>

					<div class="note">
						<p>In this section, the <a>EPUB Content Document</a> is assumed to be an <a>XHTML Content
								Document</a>. While Media Overlays can be used with <a>SVG Content Documents</a>,
							playback behavior might not be consistent and therefore interoperability is not
							guaranteed.</p>
					</div>

					<section id="sec-media-overlays-structure">
						<h5>Structure</h5>

						<p>The <a href="#elemdef-smil-body"><code>body</code></a> of a Media Overlay Document consists
							of two elements: the <a href="#elemdef-smil-par"><code>par</code> element</a> and the <a
								href="#elemdef-smil-seq"><code>seq</code> element</a>. The ordering of these elements
							MUST match the default reading order of the EPUB Content Document.</p>

						<p>The <code>par</code> element represents phrases. Each element identifies a text and audio
							component to sychronize during playback.</p>

						<p>The <code>seq</code> element represents sequences. It is used to represent nested containers
							such as sections, asides, headers, and footnotes. It allows the structure inherent in these
							containers to be retained in the Media Overlay Document.</p>

						<p>The <code>seq</code> element MUST contain an <a href="#attrdef-body-textref"
									><code>epub:textref</code> attribute</a>. The IRI [[!RFC3987]] value of this
							attribute MUST reference the corresponding structural element in an EPUB Content Document.
							As <code>seq</code> elements do not provide synchronization instructions, this attribute
							allows a Reading System to still match the element to a location in the text.</p>

								elements, representing a chapter with both a section header and a figure.</p>

						<h5>Granularity</h5>

						<p>Media Overlay <a href="#elemdef-smil-text"><code>text</code> elements'</a>
							<code>src</code> attributes refer to <a>EPUB Content Document</a> elements by their IDs
							[[XML]]. The granularity level of the Media Overlay therefore depends on how the EPUB
							Content Document is marked up. If the finest level of markup is at the paragraph level, then
							that is the finest possible level at which Media Overlay synchronization can be authored.
							Likewise, if sub-paragraph markup is available, such as [[HTML]] <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/textlevel-semantics.html#the-span-element"
									><code>span</code></a> elements representing phrases or sentences, then finer
							granularity is possible in the Media Overlay. Finer granularity gives users more precise
							results for synchronized playback when navigating by word or phrase and when searching the
							text, but increases the file size of the Media Overlay Documents.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-audio-video">
						<h5>Embedded Media</h5>

						<p>Any <a>EPUB Content Document</a> associated with a Media Overlay MAY contain embedded media
							such as video, audio, and images. The Media Overlay <a href="#elemdef-smil-text"
									><code>text</code> element</a> MAY be used in such instances to reference the
							embedded media by its ID [[!XML]] value.</p>

						<p>When a <code>text</code> element references embedded media that contains audio, the <a
								href="#elemdef-smil-audio"><code>audio</code></a> sibling element is OPTIONAL.</p>

						<p><a>Authors</a> SHOULD avoid using scripts to control playback of referenced embedded EPUB
							Content Document media, as this might conflict with Media Overlays playback behavior.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="sec-tts">
						<h5>Text-to-Speech</h5>

						<p>This specification allows the use of <a>Text-to-Speech</a> (TTS) in addition to pre-recorded
							audio clips. When a Media Overlay <a href="#elemdef-smil-text"><code>text</code> element</a>
							with no sibling <a href="#elemdef-smil-audio"><code>audio</code> element</a> references an
							element within the target <a>EPUB Content Document</a>, the contents of that referenced

				<section id="sec-docs-semantic-inflection">
					<h4>Semantic Inflection</h4>

					<p>In order to express semantic inflections, the <a href="#attrdef-epub-type"><code>epub:type</code>

					<h4>Associating Style Information</h4>

					<p>Visual rendering information for the currently-playing <a>EPUB Content Document</a> element MAY
						be expressed in the CSS Style Sheet using author-defined classes. These author-defined class
						names SHOULD be declared in the <a>Package Document</a> metadata using the metadata properties
							<a href="#active-class"><code>active-class</code></a> and <a href="#playback-active-class"
								><code>playback-active-class</code></a>. The class names are then discoverable by
						Reading Systems.</p>

					<p>The <code>active-class</code> and <code>playback-active-class</code> properties MUST NOT be used
						in conjunction with a <a href="#attrdef-refines"><code>refines</code> attribute</a>, as they are
						always considered to apply to the entire <a>Rendition</a>.</p>

					<p>This example demonstrates how Authors can associate style information with the currently-playing
						EPUB Content Document.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Although this example uses the class names <code>-epub-media-overlay-active</code> and
								<code>-epub-media-overlay-playing</code>, any class names are permitted. The class names
							chosen can be used along with any supported CSS features.</p>
					</div>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>The author-defined CSS class names, declared using the metadata properties <a
								href="#active-class"><code>active-class</code></a> and <a href="#playback-active-class"
									><code>playback-active-class</code></a> in the Package Document:</p>
						<pre>&lt;meta property="media:active-class"&gt;-epub-media-overlay-active&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="media:playback-active-class"&gt;-epub-media-overlay-playing&lt;/meta&gt;
                </pre>

						<p>The CSS Style Sheet containing the author-defined class names:</p>
						<pre>/* emphasize the active element */
.-epub-media-overlay-active {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: black !important;
}

/* fade out the inactive text */
html.-epub-media-overlay-playing * {
    color: gray;
}
</pre>

						<p>The relevant EPUB Content Document excerpt:</p>
						<pre>&lt;html&gt;
    …
    &lt;span id="txt1"&gt;This is the first phrase.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span id="txt2"&gt;This is the second phrase.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span id="txt3"&gt;This is the third phrase.&lt;/span&gt;
    …
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

					</aside>

					<p>In this example, the Reading System would apply the author-defined
							<code>-epub-media-overlay-active</code> class to each text element in the EPUB Content
						Document as it became active during playback. Conversely, the class name is removed when the
						element is no longer active. The user would see each EPUB Content Document element styled with a
						yellow background for the duration of that element's playback.</p>

					<p>The Reading System would also apply the author-defined <code>-epub-media-overlay-playing</code>
						class to the document element of the EPUB Content Document when Media Overlays playback begins.
						The class name is removed when playback stops. In the case of an XHTML Content Document, the
						class name would be applied to the <code>html</code> element. In the case of an SVG Content
						Document, it would be applied to the <code>svg</code> element. The user would see all the
						inactive text elements turn gray during Media Overlays playback. When playback stopped, the
						elements’ colors would return to their defaults.</p>

				<h3>Deprecated Features</h3>

				<p>A <strong>deprecated</strong> feature is one that is no longer recommended for use in this version of

						<p><a>Authors</a> are strongly RECOMMENDED not to use the feature in their <a>EPUB
								Publications</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>

						<p class="note">Developers are advised to consider the unlikelihood of encountering content with
							deprecated features before adding new support for them.</p>

				<p>Validation tools SHOULD alert Authors that inclusion of the feature is deprecated when encountered in
					an EPUB Publication.</p>

			<section id="legacy">
				<h3>Legacy Features</h3>

				<p>A <strong>legacy</strong> feature is one that is retained only for authoring content that is
					compatible with versions of EPUB prior to 3.0. If a feature is marked as legacy, the following hold
					true:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><a>Authors</a> MAY include the legacy feature for compatibility purposes.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a>Reading Systems</a> MUST NOT support the legacy feature in content that conforms to this
							version of EPUB.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Validation tools SHOULD NOT alert Authors about the presence of legacy features in an <a>EPUB
						Publication</a>, as their inclusion is valid for backwards compatibility. Validation tools MUST
					alert Authors if a legacy feature does not conform to its definition or otherwise breaks a usage

						href="https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/tree/master/src/main/resources/com/adobe/epubcheck/schema/30/media-overlay-30.nvdl"
						>https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/tree/master/src/main/resources/com/adobe/epubcheck/schema/30/media-overlay-30.nvdl</a>.</p>

				<p>Validation using this schema requires a processor that supports [[!NVDL]], [[!RelaxNG-Schema]],
					[[!ISOSchematron]] and [[!XMLSCHEMA-2]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The NVDL schema layer can be substituted by a multi-pass validation using the embedded RELAX NG
						and ISO Schematron schemas alone.</p>

				<h3>The <code>application/oebps-package+xml</code> Media Type</h3>

				<p>This appendix registers the media type <code>application/oebps-package+xml</code> for the EPUB
					Package Document. This registration supersedes [[!RFC4839]].</p>

				<p>The Package Document is an XML file that describes a Rendition of an EPUB Publication. It identifies
					the resources in the Rendition and provides metadata information. The Package Document and its
					related specifications are maintained and defined by the W3C’s <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/community/epub3/">EPUB 3 Community Group</a>.</p>

						<p>Clearly, it is possible to author malicious files which, for example, contain malformed data.

				<h3>The <code>application/epub+zip</code> Media Type</h3>

				<p>This appendix registers the media type <code>application/epub+zip</code> for the EPUB Open Container
					Format (OCF).</p>

				<p>An <a>OCF ZIP Container</a>, or <a>EPUB Container</a>, file is a container technology based on the
					[[!ZIP]] archive format. It is used to encapsulate the Renditions of EPUB Publications. OCF and its
					related standards are maintained and defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

					</dd>
					<dt>Encoding considerations:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>OCF ZIP Container files are binary files encoded in the <a class="media-type"
								href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/zip">
								<code>application/zip</code></a> media type.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Security considerations:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>All processors that read OCF ZIP Container files should rigorously check the size and
							validity of data retrieved.</p>
						<p>In addition, because of the various content types that can be embedded in OCF ZIP Container
							files, <code>application/epub+zip</code> may describe content that poses security
							implications beyond those noted here. However, only in cases where the processor recognizes
							and processes the additional content, or where further processing of that content is
							dispatched to other processors, would security issues potentially arise. In such cases,
							matters of security would fall outside the domain of this registration document.</p>
						<p>Security considerations that apply to <code>application/zip</code> also apply to OCF ZIP
							Container files.</p>

					<dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>None.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Published specification:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This media type registration is for the EPUB Open Container Format (OCF), as described by the
							EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.2 specification located at <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-ocf.html"
									><code>https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-ocf.html</code></a>.</p>
						<p>The EPUB OCF 3.2 specification supersedes both <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4839"
								>RFC 4839</a> and the Open Container Format 2.0.1 specification, which is located at <a
								href="http://www.idpf.org/doc_library/epub/OCF_2.0.1_draft.doc"
									><code>http://www.idpf.org/doc_library/epub/OCF_2.0.1_draft.doc</code></a>, and
							which also uses the <code>application/epub+zip</code> media type.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Applications that use this media type:</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This media type is in wide use for the distribution of ebooks in the EPUB format. The
							following list of applications is not exhaustive.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Adobe Digital Editions</li>
							<li>Aldiko</li>

				<h3>Substantive changes since <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub/epub-spec.html">EPUB
					3.2</a></h3>

				<ul>
					<li>12-Oct-2020: Added OPUS to the audio core media types with a warning that it is still subject to
						review depending on support in Mac/iOS.</li>
					<li>30-Sept-2020: The structure of the EPUB core specifications has been simplified to ease
						understanding and access to information. This specification now consolidates the authoring
						requirements from the EPUB 3.2 specification together with the Packages, Content Documents, OCF
						and Media Overlays specifications. A separate document, EPUB Reading Systems 3.3, consolidates
						the reading system requirements from those documents.</li>
