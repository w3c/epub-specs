			<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">European
					Accessibility Act (EAA)</a> is an EU directive that establishes binding accessibility targets that
				must be met by many different types of products and services to strengthen the rights of people with
				disabilities to access goods and services, including ebooks, dedicated reading software, ereading
				devices, and ecommerce.</p>

			<p>The EAA has been approved on 27 June 2019, should be implemented by EU Member States within 28 June 2022
				and will enter in force from 28 June 2025.</p>

			<p>This note aims to demonstrate that the technical requirements of the European Accessibility Act related
				to ebooks are met by the EPUB® standard.</p>

			<p>The methodology used is mapping the requirements of the EU Accessibility Act related to ebooks to the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility</a> specification.</p>

			<h2>How EPUB conforming to EPUB accessibility guidelines cover European Accessibility Act requirements</h2>

			<p>EPUB is the standard format for the creation and distribution of publications in the digital publishing
				trade sector.</p>

			<p>The specifications of the EPUB standard are based on the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform">Open Web Platform</a>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
				SVG are the core technologies used for content creation. The use of the latter means that EPUB
				publications can be written with a high degree of accessibility simply through the proper application of
				established web accessibility techniques, namely the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>
				(WCAG).</p>

			<p>In order to outline how to make fully accessible EPUBs, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/"
					>EPUB Accessibility</a> guidelines have been drafted to address two key needs in the EPUB
				ecosystem:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>discoverability of accessibility features of publications;</li>
				<li>evaluation and certification of accessible EPUB publications.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Providing accessibility metadata facilitates informed decisions about the usability of an EPUB
				publication. Consumers can examine the characteristics of the content and decide whether an EPUB
				publication is appropriate for each need.</p>

			<p>While it has always been possible to create EPUB publications with a high degree of accessibility, this
				document also establishes formal requirements for contents to be certified as accessible. These
				requirements provide EPUB creators with a clear set of guidelines for evaluating their content with
				respect to quality certification and enable it.</p>

			<p>The EPUB Accessibility does not target a single version of EPUB (most commercially available publications
				are in EPUB 3 or EPUB 2 format). It is designed to be applicable to all EPUB publications conforming to
				any version or profile, including future versions of the standard.</p>
