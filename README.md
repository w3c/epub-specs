# Repository for EPUB 3 Revisions

---

As of August 14, 2020, the [EPUB 3 Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg) is now the maintainer of the EPUB 3 specifications.

## Current version of EPUB: EPUB 3.3

On the 25th of May, 2023, the [EPUB 3 Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg) has published three 
EPUB 3.3 Recommendations ([EPUB 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/), [EPUB Reading Systems 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/), and [EPUB Accessibility 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/)), as well as a number of Working Group Notes. For a complete list of the publications by the Working Group, see the
[separate index page](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub33/).

The Working Group maintains an [errata](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/errata.html) file for all the specifications and notes. If you want to report a new
erratum, please follow the guidelines in that file.

Some issues have been left open by the Working Groups as [deferred issues](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:Status-Deferred).

## Repository Structure

The contents of each folder are as follows:

- [`archive`](/archive) -- Specifications that are no longer in active development either because the revision has finished or work has been abandoned.
- [`epub33`](/epub33) -- The specifications being revised as part of the 3.3 revision.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.
