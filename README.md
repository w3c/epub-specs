## Current version of EPUB: EPUB 3.3

On the 25th of May, 2023, the [EPUB 3 Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg) published the following EPUB 3.3 Recommendations:

- [EPUB 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/),
- [EPUB Reading Systems 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-rs-33/), and
- [EPUB Accessibility 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/).

For a complete list of publications by the Working Group, including all Working Group Notes, see the
[separate index page](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub33/).

The Working Group maintains an [errata](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/errata.html) file for all the specifications and notes. If you want to report a new
erratum, please follow the guidelines in that file.

Some issues have been left open by the Working Groups as [deferred issues](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:Status-Deferred).
Issues for specifications not actively maintained have been [marked as abandoned and closed](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AStatus-Abandoned+is%3Aclosed). These issues may be resurrected in the future if work is resumed on their respective specifications.

## Repository Structure

The contents of each folder are as follows:

- [`archive`](/archive) -- Specifications that are no longer in active development either because the revision has finished or work has been abandoned.
- [`epub33`](/epub33) -- The specifications revised as part of the 3.3 revision.
- [`epub33`](/epub34) -- The specifications being revised as part of the 3.4 revision.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.
