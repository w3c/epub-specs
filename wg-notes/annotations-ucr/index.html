                <h3>Annotating a textual section</h3>
                <p>
                    A user decides to annotate a textual section of an EPUB publication. She
                    selects the section, triggers the annotation affordance,
                    optionally enters a note, selects a highlight mode and
                    color. She then saves the annotation. The selected section
                    appears on the page with the chosen highlight.
                </p>

                <h3>Annotating an image</h3>
                <p>
                    A user annotates an image included in an EPUB publication. He selects
                    the image and triggers the annotation affordance. The
                    annotation feature is then identical to the one associated
                    with a textual selection.
                </p>

                <h3>Annotating parts of an image</h3>
                <p>
                    A user consults an EPUB publication that includes detailed
                    diagrams (e.g., in SVG) and images (e.g., in JPG or PNG)
                    visualizing a research data set. She analyses the data by
                    annotating <em>parts</em> of the diagrams and/or images by
                    selecting rectangular areas of the data visualization and
                    shares these annotations with her colleagues.

                <h3>Annotating parts of an audio clip</h3>
                <p>
                    A user consults an EPUB publication that includes an audio clip 
                    (e.g., in mp3 format). Thanks to the audio player offering the proper API, 
                    he selects a time segment in the audio clip.
                    The annotation feature is then identical to the one associated
                    with a textual selection.

                <h3>Bookmarking</h3>
                <p>
                    A user decides to bookmark a location in a reflowable EPUB publication. The
                    cursor is located where the user clicks on the screen, or at a
                    default location (often the top-left corner of the screen, for
                    left-to-right content). The user triggers the bookmark
                    affordance, optionally labels the bookmark, and
                    saves it. A bookmark icon appears on the page, near
                    the line where the cursor was positioned when the bookmark was
                    created.

                <h3>Keeping track of the Last Reading Position</h3>
                <p>
                    A user stops reading and closes the EPUB publication. 
                    He exports the EPUB publication with his annotations, bookmarks, 
                    and last reading position. 
                    He then imports the EPUB publication into another reading system that supports this specification. 
                    The reading system opens the EPUB publication at the last reading position, 
                    allowing him to continue reading from where he left off.

				<h3>Creating and formatting textual notes</h3>
            	<p>
	                A user adds an annotation to an EPUB publication after selecting an audio segment in an audio clip. 
                    He adds a textual note with rich text formatting, like emphasize, italic, underline, subtitles.

	                A user adds an annotation to an EPUB publication after selecting an image. 
                    She adds an audio note by recording her voice; the audio clip is attached 
                    to the annotation.

	                A user adds an annotation to an EPUB publication after highlighting some text. 
                    She adds an image note by drawing a sketch on her screen with her digital pen and attaching it 
                    to the annotation.

            <p>
                A user responds to an annotation by creating an new annotation that points
                to the first one, creating a thread of annotations.

				<h3>Publishing a book with annotations</h3>
            	<p>
	                A famous author annotates a book she has just written, and deals
	                with her publisher a specific edition of the EPUB version of the
	                book which includes these annotations. Readers buy this highly
	                marketed edition, open it with a reading system that supports
	                this specification, and benefit from the author's notes.
	            </p>
            </section>
            <section>
				<h3>Exporting a book with annotations</h3>
            	<p>
	                A user exports from a reading system an EPUB publication he has previously
	                annotated. He decides to save his annotations and bookmarks in
	                the EPUB package. If he imports the ebook into another reading
	                system that supports this specification, annotations and
	                bookmarks automatically appear.
	            </p>
            </section>
            <section>
				<h3>Annotations used in the publishing workflow</h3>
            	<p>
	                A copy-editor verifies an EPUB publication before publication. She opens the
	                EPUB publication in a reading system that supports this specification,
	                annotates text containing typos and images with missing
	                descriptions. She exports his set of annotations on a destination
	                folder with a specific file name, and provides the file to the
	                EPUB creator. The EPUB creator associates the annotation set
	                with the EPUB file in an editing tool that supports this
	                specification, goes through the annotations, and corrects the
	                EPUB publication.

				<h3>Annotation used in the classroom</h3>
            	<p>
	                A teacher reads an ebook and prepares some annotations. He adds
	                a keyword to each annotation so that students can group them
	                easily; examples of keywords include “clarification”,
	                “question”. He exports an annotation
	                file and shares this file with his students. His name (or
	                nickname) is attached to each annotation. The students import
	                the same ebook and the teacher's annotation file into their
	                reading system. Annotations prepared by the teacher appear
	                in the ebook. Students add their own annotations to the ebook
	                and send them back to the teacher, with keywords like “interpretation”. 
                    Their name or nickname is also attached to their annotations.

					<h2>Generating citations</h2>
					<p>
                        A student had temporary access to an EPUB publication via an academic subscription bundle.
                        He annotated the publication while he had access to it and exported his set of annotations.
                        He no longer has access to the publication after the expiration of his subscription.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These annotations are nevertheless useful to him, as they include the publication metadata (title, author, year of publication, etc.), and each annotation is associated with an indication of the progression in the publication (print pagination if present, % of progression in the publication, or the timestamp in the case of an audiobook), and contextual information like the chapter or section in which the annotation was created.
                        He can therefore generate citations in a standardized format, like APA or MLA, to include in his report. He can also use these annotations in a word processor, or in a note-taking application, to prepare a report or an essay.

            <h2>Synchronizing annotations and bookmarks</h2>
						<section>
							<h3>Synchronizing annotation among devices</h3>
							<p>
									A user annotates an EPUB publication. She synchronizes her annotations and
									bookmarks with her other personal devices via a standardized
									Cloud mechanism supported by each of these systems.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>Sharing annotations among readers</h3>
							<p>
									Participants to a book club read the same EPUB publication ebook during a
									period of time, in a reading system that supports this
									specification. Each participant adds notes to the book, and
									these annotations are shared via a standardized Cloud mechanism
									supported by their reading system. The name of each participant
									appears, so that each participant can see who made which
									annotation.

            <h2>Surviving EPUB publication versioning</h2>
            <p>
                A user has annotated yesterday a textual section of an EPUB publication and closed the
                ebook. Today, he loads a new version of the EPUB publication in his reading
                system. The spine item in which the annotations were created has
                been modified, and some words have been added to the leaf HTML
                element in which an annotation was created, before the start of
                the annotation and in the annotated text itself. Nevertheless, the user
                gets the annotation at the proper location.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same user loads a new edition of the EPUB publication in his reading
                system. A new resource – a foreword – has been added to the
                spine, and the page list has been modified. Still, the user gets
                the annotation at the proper location.
            </p>

            <h2>List of requirements</h2>
            <p>
                In this section, we will list all requirements the  
                EPUB Annotations specification must respect to fulfill the use cases 
                listed in the previous sections. 
                Not all requirements will be adopted during the implementation phase, and some 
                aspects may be postponed to future versions of the specification. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The EPUB Annotation specification should provide the following features:
