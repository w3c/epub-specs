			<h2>Annotating</h2>
			<p>
				A user decides to annotate a textual section of an EPUB. 
				He selects the section, triggers the annotation affordance, optionally enters a note, selects a highlight mode and color. 
				He then saves the annotation. 
				The selected section appears on the page with the chosen highlight.
			</p>
			<p>
				A user decides to annotate an image of an EPUB. 
				He selects the image and triggers the annotation affordance. 
				The annotation feature is then identical to the one associated with a textual selection.
			</p>
			<p>
				A user consults an EPUB publication that includes detailed diagrams (e.g., in SVG) and images (e.g., in JPG or PNG) visualizing 
				a research data set. 
				She analyses the data by annotating <em>portions</em> of the diagrams and/or images by selecting rectangular area of 
				the data visualization and shares these annotations with her colleagues.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Bookmarking</h2>
			<p>
				A user decides to bookmark a location in a reflowable EPUB. The cursor is located where the user clicks on the screen, or at a default location. 
				The user triggers the bookmark affordance, optionally selects a highlight mode & color, and saves the bookmark. 
				A bookmark icon appears on the page, near the line where the cursor was positioned when the bookmark was created.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Exporting &amp; importing annotations and bookmarks</h2>
			<p>
				A user decides to export from a reading system an EPUB he has previously annotated. 
				He decides to save his annotations and bookmarks in the EPUB package. 
				If he imports the ebook into another reading system that supports this specification, annotations and bookmarks automatically appear.
			</p>
			<p>
				A user decides to export a set of annotations from a reading application. He selects the corresponding EPUB. 
				He chooses a file name and a destination folder for the annotations file, and he validates his choice. 
				If he imports this file into another reading application that supports this specification, and if the reading application already contains this ebook, his annotations will appear in the ebook.
			</p>
			<p>
				A teacher reads an ebook and prepares some annotations. 
				He adds a keyword to each annotation so that students can group them easily; examples of keywords include “clarification”, “question”, and “interpretation” (1). 
				He exports an annotation file and shares this file with his students. 
				His name (or nickname) is attached to each annotation. 
				The students import the ebook, and then the detached annotation file into their reading application. 
				The annotations made by the teacher appear in the ebook. 
				Students can add their annotations to the ebook and send them back to the teacher. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				A user annotates an EPUB. He synchronises his annotations and bookmarks with other personal devices via a Cloud mechanism supported by his reading system.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Surviving versioning</h2>
			<p>
				A user has annotated a textual section of an EPUB and closed the ebook. 
				Today, he loads a new version of the EPUB in his reading system. The spine item in which the annotations were created has been modified, and some words have been added to the leaf HTML element in which an annotation was created, before the start of the annotation. 
				Still, the user gets the annotation at the proper location.
