                <h3>Annotating a textual section</h3>
                <p>
                    A user decides to annotate a textual section of an EPUB publication.
                    They select the section, trigger the annotation affordance,
                    optionally enter a note, select a highlight mode and
                    color. They then save the annotation. The selected section
                    appears on the page with the chosen highlight.
                </p>

                <h3>Annotating an image</h3>
                <p>

                    A user annotates an image included in an EPUB publication. They select
                    the image and trigger the annotation affordance. The
                    annotation feature is then identical to the one associated
                    with a textual selection.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Annotating parts of an image</h3>
                <p>
                    A user consults an EPUB publication that includes detailed
                    diagrams (e.g., in SVG) and images (e.g., in JPG or PNG)
                    visualizing a research data set. They analyse the data by
                    annotating <em>parts</em> of the diagrams and/or images by
                    selecting rectangular areas of the data visualization and
                    share these annotations with their colleagues.

                <p>
                    A user consults an EPUB publication that includes an audio clip 
                    (e.g., in mp3 format). Thanks to the audio player offering the proper API, 
                    they select a time segment in the audio clip.
                    The annotation feature is then identical to the one associated
                    with a textual selection.

                <h3>Bookmarking</h3>
                <p>
                    A user decides to bookmark a location in a reflowable EPUB publication. The
                    cursor is located where the user clicks on the screen, or at a
                    default location (often the top-left corner of the screen, for
                    left-to-right content). The user triggers the bookmark
                    affordance, optionally labels the bookmark, and
                    saves it. A bookmark icon appears on the screen, which helps localize the bookmarked area.

                <h3>Keeping track of the Last Reading Position</h3>
                <p>
                    A user stops reading and closes the EPUB publication. 
                    They export the EPUB publication with their annotations, bookmarks, 
                    and last reading position. 
                    They then import the EPUB publication into another reading system that supports this specification. 
                    The reading system opens the EPUB publication at the last reading position, 
                    allowing them to continue reading from where they left off.

            	<p>
	                A user adds an annotation to an EPUB publication after selecting an audio segment in an audio clip. 
                    They add a textual note with rich text formatting: 
                    emphasize, italic, underline, and subtitles.

	                A user adds an annotation to an EPUB publication after highlighting some text. 
                    They add an image note by drawing a sketch on their screen with their digital pen and attaching it 
                    to the annotation.

				<h3>Publishing a book with annotations</h3>
            	<p>
	                A famous author annotates a book they have just written, and deals
	                with their publisher a specific edition of the EPUB version of the
	                book which includes these annotations. Readers buy this highly
	                marketed edition, open it with a reading system that supports
	                this specification, and benefit from the author's notes.

				<h3>Exporting a book with annotations</h3>
            	<p>
	                A user exports from a reading system an EPUB publication they have previously
	                annotated. They decide to save their annotations and bookmarks in
	                the EPUB package. If they import the ebook into another reading
	                system that supports this specification, annotations and
	                bookmarks automatically appear.
	            </p>
            </section>
            <section>
				<h3>Annotations used in the publishing workflow</h3>
            	<p>
	                A copy-editor verifies an EPUB publication before release. They open the
	                EPUB publication in a reading system that supports this specification,
	                annotate text containing typos and images with missing
	                descriptions. They export their set of annotations to a destination
	                folder with a specific file name and provide the file to the
	                EPUB creator. The EPUB creator associates the annotation set
	                with the EPUB file in an editing tool that supports this
	                specification, reviews the annotations, and corrects the EPUB accordingly.

				<h3>Annotation used in the classroom</h3>
            	<p>
	                A teacher reads an ebook and prepares some annotations. They add
	                a keyword to each annotation so that students can group them
	                easily; examples of keywords include “clarification”,
	                “question”. They export an annotation
	                file and share this file with their students. Their name (or
	                nickname) is attached to each annotation. The students import
	                the same ebook and the teacher's annotation file into their
	                reading system. Annotations prepared by the teacher appear
	                in the ebook. Students add their own annotations to the ebook
	                and send them back to the teacher, with keywords like “interpretation”. 
                    Their name or nickname is also attached to their annotations.
	            </p>

				<h3>Annotations shared through social media</h3>
            	<p>
	                A user reads an ebook and prepares some annotations, which they feel are particularly insightful or useful. 
                    They decide to share these annotations with their followers or a broader community on a social media platform. 
                    They export their annotation file, which includes their name or nickname attached to each annotation.
                    They then post a link to the annotation file on their social media page, perhaps with a short description or a teaser of the content. 
                    They may offer the file for free or charge a small fee using an integrated payment system. 
                    Another user, who is reading the same ebook, sees the post and decides to download the annotation file. 
                    They import the annotations into their own reading system. 
                    The annotations from the original user appear in the ebook, enriching their reading experience with new perspectives. 
                    The other user can also add their own annotations and potentially share them in the same manner, creating a chain of shared knowledge.

					<h2>Generating citations</h2>
					<p>
							A student had temporary access to an EPUB publication via an academic subscription bundle.
							They annotated the ebook while they had access to it and exported their set of annotations.
							They no longer have access to the ebook.

							These annotations are nevertheless useful to them, as they include ebook metadata 
                (title, author, year of publication), and each annotation is associated with an indication 
                of the progression in the publication (print pagination if present, % of progression in the publication, 
                timestamp in the case of an audiobook), and contextual information like the chapter or section 
                in which the annotation was created.
							They can generate citations in a standardized format, like APA or MLA, 
                to include in their report. They can then use these annotations in a word processor, 
                or in a note-taking application, to prepare a report or an essay.

            <h2>Synchronizing annotations and bookmarks</h2>
						<section>
							<h3>Synchronizing annotation among devices</h3>
							<p>
									A user annotates an EPUB publication. They synchronize their annotations and
									bookmarks with their other personal devices via a standardized
									Cloud mechanism supported by each of these systems.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>Sharing annotations among readers</h3>
							<p>
									Participants in a book club read the same EPUB publication ebook during a
									period of time, in a reading system that supports this
									specification. Each participant adds notes to the ebook, and
									these annotations are shared via a standardized Cloud mechanism
									supported by their reading system. The name of each participant
									appears, so that each participant can see who made which
									annotation.

            <h2>Surviving EPUB publication versioning</h2>
            <p>
                A user has annotated a textual section of an EPUB publication and closed the
                ebook. Today, they load a new version of the EPUB publication in their reading
                system. The spine item in which the annotations were created has
                been modified, and some words have been added to the leaf HTML
                element in which an annotation was created, before the start of
                the annotation and in the annotated text itself. Nevertheless, the user
                gets the annotation at the proper location.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same user loads a new edition of the EPUB publication in their reading
                system. A new resource - a foreword - has been added to the
                spine, and the page list has been modified. Still, the user gets
                the annotation at the proper location.
            </p>

            <h2>List of requirements</h2>
            <p>
                In this section, we will list all requirements the  
                EPUB Annotations specification must respect to fulfill the use cases 
                listed in the previous sections. 
                Not all requirements will be adopted during the implementation phase, and some 
                aspects may be postponed to future versions of the specification. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The EPUB Annotation specification should provide the following features: 
            </p>
