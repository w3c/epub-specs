		<title>Introduction</title>

		<para>EPUB® is an interchange and delivery format for digital publications, based on XML and Web Standards. An EPUB
			Publication can be thought of as a reliable packaging of Web content that represents a digital book, magazine, or
			other type of publication, and that can be distributed for online and offline consumption. </para>

		<para>This document, EPUB 3.1 Changes from EPUB 3.0.01, describes changes made in the first major revision of the
			EPUB 3.0 specifications, highlighting key changes and additions.</para>

		<para>This document is non-normative. Consult the EPUB specification documents for definitive information on EPUB

			<title>EPUB Revision History</title>

			<para>EPUB had its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication Structure (OEBPS). OEBPS
				1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an organization that later became the International Digital
				Publishing Forum (IDPF). Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the IDPF in 2001 and 2002
				respectively.</para>

			<para> It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for delivery as well as
				interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container format for OEPBS, which was approved by
				the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS began in parallel which
				was approved as the renamed EPUB 2.0 in October, 2007, consisting of a triumvirate of specifications: Open
				Package Format (OPF), Open Publication Format (OPF) together with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a maintenance update to
				the 2.0 specification set primarily intended clarify and correct errata in the specifications, was approved
				in September, 2010. <xref linkend="refOPF2"/>
				<xref linkend="refOPS2"/>
				<xref linkend="refOCF2"/></para>

			<para>Work on a major new 3.0 revision of the EPUB specifications began in 2010, with the goal of aligning EPUB
				more closely with HTML5, and in the process bringing new, native multimedia features, sophisticated CSS
				layout rendering and font embedding, scripted interactivity, enhanced global language support, and improved
				accessibility. A new specification, EPUB Media Overlays was also introduced, enabling text and audio
				synchronization in EPUB Publications. To better align the specification names with the standard, the Open
				Package Format specification was renamed EPUB Publications and the Open Publication Format specification was
				renamed EPUB Content Documents. The EPUB 3.0 specifications were approved in October, 2011. <xref
