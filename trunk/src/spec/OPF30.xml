            <para>This specification, the Open Packaging Format 3.0 (OPF3) , defines an XML schema
                for a package file format and associated document type that enables the various
                components of an an abstract publication (set of related resources) can be
                associated. Specifically, OPF3 enables representation of a publication that:</para>

                    <listitem><para>Enumerates and describes all its resources and their media types. </para></listitem>

            <para>OPF3 is a general-purpose technology. While illustrative examples in this
                specification may be based on the use of OPF3 by EPUB, all conformance requirements
                specific to EPUB as an application of OPF are defined in the EPUB
                specification.</para>

            <para>This specification relies on several other building-block specifications. OPF is
                an application of XML, and by default all terminology used in this specification has
                the same meaning as its use in XML. OPF also relies on XML Namespaces, and i this
                specification the term "XML namespace" (or just "namespace") has the meaning defined
                in that specification. Additionally, OPF utilizes X, Y, and Z. </para>
            <para>OPF3 is a revision to, and supersedes, Open Package Format 2.0.1 (OPF2), with
                respect to the definition of the Package Document schema. Other information from
                OPF2 has been superseded by EPUB Publications 3.0 (Publications3).</para>

        <title>OPF Package Documents</title>
        <para>Open Package Format 3.0 (OPF3) is purposely designed as a general technology that can
            be used by other file formats, not just EPUB. The fundamental construct defined in this
            specification is a Package Document, which is set of enumerated resources (the
            manifest), which contains an ordered sequence of top-level resources from which all
            other resources in the set can be reached or utilized in the context of a given
            application of OPF3 (the spine).</para>

                fallback chains, a fallback-style, and sharing resources between roots.</remark>In
            addition Package Documents include a means of including and/or referencing metadata
            applicable to the entire collection including a means for referencing a "TOC" item, an
            optional means for an item to reference an ordered list of alternative items (a fallback
            chain) and/or a style resource, and an additional optional sequence of some or all
            top-level resources (the Guide).</para>

                parts of Package Documents, concise form of list in sec 2.0 OPF 2.0.1.</remark>The
            semantics of processing Package Documents is considered application specific and is not
            provided in this specification. At the level of this specification, items of any kind
            (including style objects, metadata objects, and TOC) are simply abstract URI references
            to resources that specify a MIME type, whose significance is not defined in this
            specification. Inter-item references are always via id attributes. A valid Package
            Document must meet the abstract conformance requirements of this specification, but
            would typically need to meet additional requirements to be conformant in the context of
            a particular application, such as requiring that certain references be to items of a
            specific MIME type supported by that application. NOTE: the semantics of processing
            Package Documents in the context of [EPUB] are defined in [EPUB Publications]. </para>

                identifier. The OPF Package Document's author is responsible for choosing a primary
                identifier that is unique to one and only one particular package (i.e., the set of
